The Oxford group has applied the &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1093/mnras/stw706"&gt;K2 Systematics Correction (K2SC)&lt;/a&gt; Gaussian Process-based detrending algorithm to project generated long-cadence light curves from Campaigns 3 to 6. This algorithm simultaneously models astrophysical variability and pointing systematics, enabling the user to disentangle the two and remove either or both. These light curves are therefore well-suited to searches for transits and other short-lived events in the light curves of variable active stars, or to studying stellar variability. Additional campaigns will be added as the data becomes available and the source code is &lt;a href="https://github.com/OxES/k2sc"&gt;available from Github&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This release complements the K2 data already hosted at the MAST, which includes the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/"&gt;project generated data products&lt;/a&gt;, and community generated &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html"&gt;High Level Science Products&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 7 data available</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-7-data-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-22T15:00:00-07:00</published><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2016-04-22:k2-campaign-7-data-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Target pixel files for long and short cadence targets for K2 Campaign 7 are now available for download 
from the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/"&gt;K2 data archive at MAST&lt;/a&gt;.  Light curves are also available for long cadence targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. There were also several custom targets.  We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-7"&gt;data release notes&lt;/a&gt; are available on the Kepler &amp;amp; K2 Science Center website.  We encourage users to read these carefully; in particular, note that there was an increase in roll drift in Campaign 7 due to the use of an alternate low-gain antenna during science data collection.  This increase in roll motion, combined with an extremely crowded field, impacted the photometry produced by the Kepler pipeline.  Additional details are available in the full data release notes.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Kepler recovered and K2 mission underway again</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/kepler-recovered-and-k2-mission-underway-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-22T11:00:00-07:00</published><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2016-04-22:kepler-recovered-and-k2-mission-underway-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Kepler spacecraft has officially been recovered since it was

of a puzzling difference between the short- and long-cadence
calibrated pixel data for a specific K2 target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After investigation, the problem was traced to an accounting error
for the short-cadence collateral smear data.
Under some conditions, these data are passed incorrectly
between the spacecraft and the ground, causing smear values to be
assigned to the wrong columns within a target‚Äôs aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these cases, the pipeline‚Äôs pixel-level calibration routine
applies an erroneous smear correction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="impact"&gt;Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue has been present since launch and affects both the target pixel
files and the light curves of approximately
half of all short-cadence targets in all releases to date,
i.e. Kepler Data Releases 1-24 and K2 Data Releases for Campaigns 0-5.
A list of all the affected targets is attached below.
The long cadence data for these or other targets is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the smear signal is often small compared to the target signal,
the effect is negligible for many targets.
However, the smear signal is scene-dependent,
so time-varying signals can be introduced into an affected target
by the other stars falling on the same CCD column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the impact on affected targets,
users should inspect the calibrated target pixels
(see Section 2.3.2 of the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/archive_manual.pdf"&gt;Kepler Archive Manual&lt;/a&gt;).
An improperly corrected smear signal may show up as an anomalously bright,
or dark, column in the calibrated target pixel image.
Comparison of the short-cadence pixel image with the long-cadence pixel image
(which is not affected by this problem)
can be used to estimate the magnitude of any contaminating signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="solution"&gt;Solution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kepler pipeline has been amended to ensure that the 
correct smear data is used at all times. 
All affected data will be corrected as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All upcoming K2 data releases will be corrected from the start,
 beginning with Campaign 6. (The release of C6 short cadence data will be delayed by approximately two weeks as a result.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reprocessing of K2 Campaigns 0-5 will occur over the coming months. The expected release dates will be listed here when known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data from the prime Kepler mission will be corrected as part of the scheduled reprocessing with pipeline release 9.3 (DR25). Corrected target pixel files are expected to be available in Summer 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

in the position of Campaigns 11, 12, and 13,
for which target proposals are currently being solicited as part of the 
&lt;a href="call-for-k2-go-cycle-4-proposals-for-campaigns-11-12-and-13.html"&gt;K2 Guest Observer Cycle 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change, explained below, alters ~0.2% of sky area covered
and is unlikely to affect the vast majority of proposals.
All users are nevertheless encouraged to update the 
&lt;a href="software.html#k2fov"&gt;K2fov&lt;/a&gt; target selection tool
to version 4.0, which was released on 27 Jan 2016 to include the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install K2fov --upgrade
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -c "import pkg_resources; print(pkg_resources.require('K2fov')[0].version)"
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should return "4.0.0" or higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 are being rotated slightly to
accommodate a change in the configuration of the Kepler spacecraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these Campaigns, spacecraft telemetry will be downlinked
using a different low-gain antenna than before:
&lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; instead of &lt;i&gt;LGA1&lt;/i&gt;.
This antenna provides a better orientation to Earth
and compensates for the increasing range 
of the spacecraft to the Earth (now 0.8 AU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change of antenna was recently trialled during Campaign 7,
where it was found to cause a small increase in the roll drift rate.
The reduced pointing performance was understood to be caused
by the antenna's radiation pressure,
which torques the spacecraft slightly differently when &lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; is used,
increasing the roll rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To optimize fuel usage and photometric precision,
the K2 team has decided to adjust the roll angle
of Campaigns 11, 12, and 13 by a very small amount
(0.12--0.16 degrees) to optimally balance the spacecraft
against solar pressure and antenna radiation
when &lt;i&gt;LGA2&lt;/i&gt; is in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, there is a minor change in the fields of view covered by K2
during these campaigns. The position of the CCD edges
are being shifted by ~0.5 arcsec (~0.1 px) near the center of the
focal plane, and by up to 60 arcsec (~15 px) near the corners.
The change is illustrated in the figure below,
which shows the change in sky coverage for a single CCD channel
near the corner of C11,
where the shift is the most significant.&lt;/p&gt;

are currently being solicited as part of &lt;a href="call-for-k2-go-cycle-4-proposals-for-campaigns-11-12-and-13.html"&gt;K2 Guest Observer Cycle 4&lt;/a&gt;.
Step 1 submissions for these proposals are due on &lt;strong&gt;February 5, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="k2-fields.html"&gt;fields of these campaigns&lt;/a&gt; 
will cover roughly 100 square degrees at a time near the
constellations of Ophiucus (C11), Aquarius (C12), and Taurus (C13).
All the objects that will be observed during these campaigns must be
requested by the community through the Cycle 4 call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community select and propose the most interesting targets,
the Guest Observer Office has prepared a "K2-SIMBAD" catalog which lists all 240,000 objects which appear in the &lt;a href="http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr"&gt;SIMBAD database&lt;/a&gt; and will fall within the fields of future K2 Campaigns.
The catalog details object IDs, spectral types, object classifications, citation counts, proper motions, and selected photometry as recorded in SIMBAD. It can be &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/tree/master/simbad"&gt;downloaded in full from our GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The K2-SIMBAD catalog does not replace the &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;EPIC Input Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, which remains the principal target selection tool. Instead it provides an overview of objects that have appeared in the literature and may hence trigger or inspire K2 Cycle 4 proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below we list a selection of notable objects that we encountered in the  catalog, along with interesting Solar System bodies
that will be visible as determined by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem"&gt;K2ephem tool&lt;/a&gt;.  This list is not exhaustive by any means and we encourage members of the community to share missing highlights for inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

Mandatory Step 1 submissions for these proposals are due on &lt;strong&gt;February 5, 2016&lt;/strong&gt;, followed by a Step 2 deadline on March 4th, 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals must be accompanied by a &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table"&gt;target table&lt;/a&gt; (by the Step 2 deadline) which details the objects
to be observed.
To enable the community to select and propose the most interesting targets,
the following resources are available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (&lt;strong&gt;EPIC&lt;/strong&gt;) has been updated to include targets for Campaigns 11-13. The catalogs can be &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php"&gt;queried online&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/catalogs/"&gt;downloaded in text format&lt;/a&gt; from MAST.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2fov"&gt;K2fov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; package has been updated to include the details of fields 11-12-13, along with the preliminary positions of fields 14 through 17. Installing the package adds two executables to the command line, &lt;em&gt;K2onSilicon&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;K2findCampaigns&lt;/em&gt;, which allow the visibility of targets to be checked during one or all campaigns.  If you have a previous version of K2fov installed, it is crucial that you upgrade to version 3.0 or higher ("pip install K2fov --upgrade").&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new package called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2ephem"&gt;K2ephem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; has been built on top of K2fov to allow the visibility of Solar System bodies, i.e. asteroids and comets, to be checked in a user-friendly way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;sky footprints&lt;/strong&gt; of past and future campaigns have been made available
as &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html#machine-readable-files"&gt;machine-readable text files&lt;/a&gt;. These files detail the coordinates of the CCD corners during each Campaign and allow users to create custom visualizations or run custom target selection algorithms.  The footprints are also available in the &lt;a href="k2-fields.html#moc-format"&gt;MOC data format&lt;/a&gt; which can be opened and visualized using the &lt;a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/"&gt;Aladin interactive sky atlas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The planet Uranus will be observed for roughly a month in short cadence and the remaining time in long cadence, in addition four of its moons make the long cadence target list. Six Trojan asteroids and four TNOs round out the solar system targets.
The irregular dwarf galaxy IC 1613 will be observed with a large pixel mask and several very bright stars will be targeted using custom pixel masks that only collect the wings of the PSF.&lt;/p&gt;

The problem was traced to an error in the pipeline module that calibrates the pixels, specifically in how it handles the black model calculated by the Dynablack algorithm. As a result, the SC calibrated pixels available in the target pixel files, and the light curves based on these pixels, are excessively noisy.   All DR24 SC data processed by CAL using Dynablack are affected.  In other words, only the SC data from Q0, Q1 and Q17, as well as a few select channels in Q2--Q16, are valid.  Unfortunately, no flag exists in the DR24 data files to indicate whether a target was calibrated using Dynablack.  Users are encouraged to regress to an earlier data release, if they have the required files in their possession (i.e., these earlier releases are no longer available from the MAST archive), or they can wait for the next and final SC data release (DR25).   This calibration problem has been fixed and the final reprocessing is expected to be available in Summer, 2016.  There is no impact on the long-cadence data for either DR24 or DR25.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 9 Microlensing Science Team Selected</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-9-microlensing-science-team-selected.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-11-06T15:00:00-08:00</published><author><name>Knicole Colon</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-11-06:k2-campaign-9-microlensing-science-team-selected.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html"&gt;K2 Campaign 9&lt;/a&gt; will be executed in April 2016 and
will be dedicated to a study of gravitational microlensing events. The
Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft
observing in the +VV direction at fields toward the Galactic
bulge. The aim of this program is to simultaneously observe
gravitational microlensing events with K2 and from Earth in order to
see a parallax effect in the shape and time of the lensing event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microlensing Science Team (MST) was selected through a peer-review
process during K2 GO Cycle 3 by a panel of experts. The aim of the MST
is to both coordinate with and make recommendations to the K2 mission
regarding the best observational methods to use during Campaign 9,
allowing the highest value science return. Additionally, the MST will
serve the interests of the community by, for example, facilitating simultaneous
ground-based data collection, developing novel methods for crowded
field photometry, and providing completeness and reliability studies
of detected microlensing events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MST is comprised of the following people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Bennett (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Calen Henderson (JPL/Caltech)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Hogg (New York University)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matthew Penny (Ohio State University)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rachel Street (Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Campaign 9 differs from previous and future K2 Campaigns (where targets are proposed by
the community at large), the Guest Observer Office is offering a small number of pixels for approved Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) programs.

&lt;p&gt;The workshop, called "NASA Planetary Science and Astrophysics Assets," will be held all day on Tuesday, 10 November 2015, in the Azalea 1 room at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;b&gt;9:00 am and 10:30 am&lt;/b&gt;, the workshop will focus on the K2 mission.
The schedule is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;K2 background (15 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Thomas Barclay, NASA Ames&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Targeting solar system bodies (10 mins) - &lt;i&gt;Geert Barentsen, NASA Ames&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Q&amp;amp;A (5 mins)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fields observed by K2 are close to the ecliptic plane
and rich in solar system objects including planets, asteroids 
and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). 
K2 has already performed observations of Neptune and its large moon Triton, 68 Trojan and Hilda asteroids, 5 TNOs (including Pluto) and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). About thousands of main-belt asteroids that fell into the pixel masks of stars have been have been serendipitously observed. Uranus will be observed in a future campaign (C8), as will many more small solar system bodies. Observations of moving bodies as bright as Jupiter and as faint as V=23 have proved successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;K2 has an ongoing funded Guest Observer program and which has been successfully proposed to by members of the planetary science community. We present K2‚Äôs plans and capabilities for solar system science and will have presentations by members of the planetary science community who have used K2 data. This presentation contains information about the mission and its capabilities, discusses the proposal cycles and provides examples, and has community folks talking about their K2 science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage members of the planetary science community interested in using the long-baseline, high-cadence, high-precision photometry provided by the Kepler spacecraft to join the workshop.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Science Conference Deadline Fast Approaching</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-science-conference-deadline-fast-approaching.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-15T11:00:00-07:00</published><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-09-15:k2-science-conference-deadline-fast-approaching.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The September 18 deadline for early registration, hotel reservation, &amp;amp; abstract submission for the &lt;a href="http://lcogt.net/k2scicon/"&gt;K2SciCon&lt;/a&gt; is just a few days away.

Given the proposal review timeline, and associated data processing and archive activities, there can be a significant delay between proposal submission and final target selection for each K2 campaign. To provide a faster mechanism for headline astrophysics with K2 we provide an alternative means for acquiring K2 data, through the Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the DDT program for K2 is to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Respond to targets of opportunity, e.g. newly discovered exoplanets or supernovae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yield high-impact science from K2 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enhance existing GO programs with additional data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DDT program for K2 occurs on a rolling basis; observations can be proposed for at any time starting with targets in Campaign 8. However, to ensure that approved targets are included in the final target lists for each campaign, proposals must be submitted by the following dates:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;October 5, 2015 for Campaign 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;December 10, 2015 for Campaign 9&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;March 10, 2016 for Campaign 10&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposals require a 2-page scientific justification and a target table and should be &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-ddt.html"&gt;submitted on the DDT page&lt;/a&gt;. The required format as well as a &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-proposing-targets.html#target-table"&gt;template for the target table can be found here&lt;/a&gt;. The fixed locations and observing windows of Campaigns 8, 9, and 10 are provided at &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html"&gt;the field information page&lt;/a&gt;. Target overlap with the current GO target list will not be considered unless short cadence observations are being requested of a current long cadence target. DDT proposals will be sent to external reviewers; final selection will be at the discretion of the Guest Observer Office Director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect to observe several hundred targets through the DDT program, which amounts to a few per cent of the total targets allocated. The exact number of DDTs to be observed largely depends on the number of short versus long cadence DDTs approved. There is no proprietary period and no associated funding for approved DDT programs. Proposals from any institution are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We particularly encourage DDT proposals for Campaign 9, which is a non-standard campaign. The Campaign 9 microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft observing in the positive velocity vector (+VV) direction at fields toward the Galactic bulge. This allows for simultaneous observations from Earth during Campaign 9. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>K2 Campaign 7 Science Program Available</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-campaign-7-science-program-available.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-10T15:00:00-07:00</published><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-09-10:k2-campaign-7-science-program-available.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 &lt;a href="k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-7"&gt;Campaign 7 Target List&lt;/a&gt; has now been posted. In Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns. This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Updated K2 Data Release Schedule</title><link href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-10T14:00:00-07:00</published><author><name>Thomas Barclay</name></author><id>tag:keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov,2015-09-10:updated-k2-data-release-schedule.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The K2 project have updated the dates we expect to release K2 data to the &lt;a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/"&gt;MAST&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the dust clouds near the Pleiades, the background removal near the cluster has larger than normal residuals. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/K2drn/C4/C4_reduced_ap_targets.txt"&gt;887 stellar targets&lt;/a&gt; that have light curves with more noise than expected, as they were likely created with non-optimal apertures.  This is due to incompatibility between K2 roll motion and determination of photometric optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fraction (23.8%) of stellar targets have light curves generated from apertures that are larger than optimal because they have lower than expected flux compared to their Kepler magnitudes in the EPIC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A different group of stars have higher than expected flux, also resulting in non-optimal apertures.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While all results are scientifically significant, there are some that hold the added luster of public appeal. At the basic level, public appeal can be qualified as 'firsts' (the first Earth-sized planet); has a tie to popular culture (Kepler-16b or "Tatooine" and is also a 'first'); or sparks curiosity (catching a supernova before the explosion, or a disintegrating planet).

&lt;p&gt;Our pointing has been significantly better than our conservative pointing assumptions we used when we built our pixel cost algorithms. The result of this is that we can observe about double the number of targets from Campaign 5 onwards compared with Campaign 4 and earlier. The increase is from about 15,000 total to around 30,000 total. Unfortunately, the telemetry data to determine that we were able to do this was no available in time for the K2 GO Cycle 2 proposal deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this affect you? You may wish to consider submitting larger target lists than in previous cycles in any Cycle 3 proposals you are submitting.

&lt;p&gt;Dr Geert Barentsen joins us from the University of Hertfordshire in the UK. Geert's background is in the exploitation of photometry from wide-area surveys. In Hertfordshire he leads the data processing of two projects which aim to map our own Milky Way in unprecedented detail: &lt;a href="http://www.iphas.org"&gt;IPHAS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.vphas.eu"&gt;VPHAS+&lt;/a&gt;. He also teaches a university's programming and statistics class, and is a contributor to the &lt;a href="http://www.astropy.org"&gt;AstroPy&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geert earned his doctorate at the Queen's University of Belfast in 2012 where he studied star formation using narrow-band photometry. Prior to his PhD, he obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Antwerp in Belgium, after which he gained professional experience in data science at the European Space Agency in The Netherlands and the Royal Meteorological Institute in Belgium. In his spare time, he studies the activity of meteor showers using data collected by amateur astronomers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Knicole Col√≥n leaves a postdoctoral role at Lehigh University as a member of the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilodegree_Extremely_Little_Telescope"&gt;KELT project&lt;/a&gt; to join us at Kepler. Her expertise is in the discovery and characterization of transiting exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a graduate student at the University of Florida, Knicole demonstrated the capability of OSIRIS on the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) for exoplanet science.  After earning her doctorate in 2012, she gained postdoctoral experience at the University of Hawaii and Lehigh University.  There, she focused on the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with narrow-band photometry and in the confirmation of planets around bright stars discovered by the KELT transit survey.&lt;/p&gt;

This data was collected between Feb 4-13, 2014, before Campaign 0, and points to a different region of sky to Campaign 0, RA = 359 deg, Dec = -2 deg. In future publications and presentations, we would be grateful if you referred to these data collectively as the "Two-wheel Concept Engineering Test". The motivation for delivering this test data is described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help the community in the endeavor of maximizing photometric quality and precision of a two-wheel mission we have delivered &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/"&gt;engineering data to the MAST archive&lt;/a&gt;. The Kepler spacecraft operated with fine-guidance, collecting data from 2,017 target masks. The properties and quality of the data therein is expected to be similar to those collected during Campaign 0 and provide an excellent opportunity for scientists to make an early and impactful start upon their investigations. Note also that the chances of there being undiscovered planet transits in this engineering set are high and the potential for other serendipitous science is great. To this end we have also provided lists of &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/K2_E2_targets_lc.csv"&gt;long cadence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/tpf_eng/K2_E2_targets_sc.csv"&gt;short cadence&lt;/a&gt; targets with a brief description of why each was observed during the test. For those investigators eager to develop this test data scientifically and those investigators with the enthusiasm to develop new technical solutions for two-wheel photometry, we encourage you to dive wholeheartedly into this data set. A typical file size for one of these target pixel files is 26 MB. The Kepler Science Center will not support this engineering data with future reprocessings, deliveries or new products. However the Kepler Science Center will support questions through the helpdesk regarding this data set on a best-effort basis. &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
