The K2 [Campaign 5 Target List](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC05.shtml) has now been posted. The Campaign 5 target list consists of 25,099 standard long cadence and 204 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over dwarf planet (126154) 2002 YH140. We also observed the open cluster M67. The cluster was tiled with 73 individual apertures to create a contiguous 400x400 pixel region over two channels.
