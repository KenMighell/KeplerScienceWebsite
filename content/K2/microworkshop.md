*Note that this meeting will now be hosted at the SETI Inst.*

In April of 2016, the NASA K2 mission will execute Campaign 9, a continuous 75-day long campaign targeting the galactic bulge dedicated to a single Microlensing Science Experiment. The [NASA K2 mission](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2) is sponsoring a [1.5-day workshop on the topic of the K2 Microlensing Experiment](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop) on May 7-8, 2015. 

The motivations for holding this workshop are two-fold: Firstly to provide an opportunity for interactive planning for the K2 Microlensing Experiment amongst NASA, the K2 project and the scientific community; and secondly to serve as a pre-proposal discussion opportunity in advance of the submission of K2 Microlensing Science Team proposals.

K2 project staff will describe the observing plan and operating procedures for up-linking target lists, down-linking the observed data and the time-line for archiving products. NASA HQ and K2 staff will present information regarding the proposal process, possible avenues for investigation, and funding. We are also inviting attendees to present information valuable in the planning and preparation for the experiment.

This workshop will begin at 9.00am PST on Thursday May 7 and end at 12.00pm PST on Friday May 8, 2015. The venue will be the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. We are intending to have available limited facilities for [virtual participation](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Callin). To [apply to attend the workshop](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/Apply) either in-person or virtually you will need to fill in the [application form](http://goo.gl/forms/ESGRMC8vOJ). The deadline for applying to attend is April 17, 2015 at 4.00pm PST.
