Data processing for K2 Campaign 3 is now complete
and the pixel files are in the process of being transferred to the [MAST archive](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data will become available to the public by the end of next week.
As for previous K2 campaigns, there will be no proprietary period for using or publishing the data.

The [Campaign 3 target list](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/GuestInvestigationsC03.shtml) included 16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets.
In addition we have included large pixel masks over dwarf planet (225088) 2007 OR10, the planet Neptune and its moon Nereid.

Keep an eye on this blog for a release announcement.
