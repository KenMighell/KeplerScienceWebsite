The K2 Guest Observer Cycle 3 proposal call is observations of targets in Campaigns 8 and 10. The due date for Step-1 proposals (essentially a compulsory notice of intent) is June 2, 2015 at midnight Eastern Time. Investigators may not submit a Full Proposal (Step-2) without first submitting a Step-1 proposal by the due date.

Cycle 3 also include Campaign 9, which is dedicated to observing gravitational microlensing events. No proposals seeking to observe targets in C9 will be considered. The proposal call for this campaign is to join a Microlensing Science Team.
