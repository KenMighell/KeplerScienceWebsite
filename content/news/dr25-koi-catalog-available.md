The latest version of the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) Catalog, version DR25, is [now available in the NASA Exoplanet Archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/exonews_archive.html#23March2017).

The catalog details all the transit-like features
across the full data set of the original Kepler mission,
i.e. Quarters 1 through 17,
as found by the Kepler pipeline and vetted by the *RoboVetter*.
Details on the nature and contents of the catalog can be found in the
[DR25 KOI Companion Document](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/Q1Q17-DR25-KOIcompanion.html).

The catalog will be the first of its kind to be accompanied by
a full suite of detection reliability and completeness measurements,
and will hence be the recommended catalog
for estimating planet occurence rates.
A [first set of these accompanying products](
http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/Kepler_completeness_reliability.html) have been released alongside the catalog,
and additional products will be released as they become available
over the next months.

Further details on the DR25 data products,
and their use for occurence rates measurements,
will be described in a forthcoming paper and accompanying talks
to be presented at the [Kepler & K2 Science Conference IV](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/scicon4/). (Note: abstract and foreign registration deadline: March 31!)
