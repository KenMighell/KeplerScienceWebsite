With the astronomy job season in full swing,
we alert our community to several post-doctoral job opportunities
which emphasize the use of Kepler and K2 data:

* [postdoc position at Aarhus University](http://phys.au.dk/en/news/vacancies/) (closes Dec 1);
* [postdoc position at the University of California, Riverside](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/22e19437) (closes Dec 15);
* [postdoc position at Caltech/IPAC/NExScI](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/c15f9a29) (closes Dec 20);
* [postdoc position at Penn State University](https://jobregister.aas.org/ad/26c7683d) (closes Jan 15);
* [postdoc position at NASA Ames](https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/details/?ro=19108) (open until filled).

We also note that multiple Kepler/K2 users have been successful
in securing fellowships in recent years.
For example, applications for the [NASA Hubble Fellowship Program](https://nhfp.stsci.edu/)
(which replaces the previous Einstein, Hubble, and Sagan Fellowship Programs)
are due by Nov 2nd, 2017.

Finally, MAST is [seeking to hire two Archive Scientists](https://rn11.ultipro.com/SPA1004/JobBoard/JobDetails.aspx?__ID=*4BD21BA9BCB520B4) to provide scientific, technical and computational expertise to improve the MAST Archive (closes Dec 15).
