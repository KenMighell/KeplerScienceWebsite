The project has decided that raw data from the currently on-going 
[K2 Campaign 12](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-12)
will be released immediately after downlink.
C12 includes the high-profile TRAPPIST-1 exoplanet system.

The raw data will be available from a
[public directory](https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/c12_raw_cadence_data)
at the MAST data archive on or near March 6th.
The use of the raw data files requires an intimate understanding
of their format and caveats.
The [kadenza tool](https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza) may be used 
to convert the raw files into uncalibrated FITS images for quicklook purposes.
The traditional pipeline-processed calibrated data products will be released 
within 2 to 3 months after the end of the Campaign, as usual.

The decision to release the raw data was triggered by
a request from members of the K2 community.
Similar requests may be made for future Campaigns
by sending a well-motivated justification to
[keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov),
no later than one month before the end of a Campaign.
