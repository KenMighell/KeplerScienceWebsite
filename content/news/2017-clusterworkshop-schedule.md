The K2 Mission and Boston University (BU) are convening a small workshop on Dwarf Stars and Clusters with K2,
to take place from January 16 to 18, 2018, on the BU campus in Boston, Massachusetts. The first two days will
consist of science talks by attendees, while the last day will be an "unconference" dedicated to K2 product
tutorials and opportunities for participants to collaborate on ideas for data management and software tools.

A preliminary schedule is now posted on the [workshop website](/cluster-workshop).
