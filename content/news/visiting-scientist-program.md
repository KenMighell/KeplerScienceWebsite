The Kepler &amp; K2 missions are launching a *Visiting Scientist Program*.

The Program enables users of Kepler or K2 data
to visit the mission headquarters at NASA Ames in California,
for a period of multiple weeks or months,
to work on a research project that would benefit from close interaction
with [Kepler/K2 team members and instrument experts](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/kepler/team/teamroster).
Visitors will also be expected to give a seminar at Ames.

Interested participants should submit a <2-page proposal
that includes an outline of the research project, relevant experience,
and the desired duration and period of the visit.
Astronomers of all career stages may apply.

Proposals may be submitted at any time
via e-mail to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov).
They will be evaluated at the start of each month
with respect to several factors, including:

* scientific merit of the proposed project;
* benefit of having access to Kepler/K2 experts to carry out the project;
* contribution of the project to Kepler/K2â€™s long-term legacy.

Funds will normally be available to support the travel and lodging expenses
of successful applicants, to be agreed upon acceptance.
