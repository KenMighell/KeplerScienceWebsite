The final reprocessing of the Kepler Q0-Q17 short cadence data has been completed. The new target pixel and lightcurve files are currently being ingested into the [Kepler data archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/).

This release (DR25) corrects both the scrambled collateral smear issue reported in the Global Erratum for Kepler Q0-Q17 & K2 C0-C5 Short-Cadence Data ([KSCI-19080-002.pdf](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/KSCI-19080-002.pdf)) and the Dynablack calibration problem reported in the Data Release 24 Notes Q0â€“Q17 Erratum ([KSCI-19064-002a-DRN24err.pdf](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/release_notes/release_notes24/KSCI-19064-002a-DRN24err.pdf)).

A revised version of the Data Release Notes 25 will be available soon.
