The due date for Step-1 proposals is 23:59 EST 23 Sep 2016.
Step-2 proposals are due by 23:59 EST 4 Nov 2016.
Investigators may not submit a Step-2 proposal without first submitting a Step-1 proposal by the due date.

evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility,
target selection tools, submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on the [proposal preparation page](/k2-proposing-targets.html).


### K2fov update required

The final field positions for Campaigns 14, 15, and 16 have recently
been set based on community input.
All investigators *must* update their version of the
<a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov target selection tool</a>
to version 5.0, released on 1 Aug 2016,
to take the final field positions into account. 

K2fov can be updated from the command line using pip:

    pip install K2fov --upgrade

The version number of your K2fov installation may be verified
using the following command:

    python -c "import K2fov; print(K2fov.__version__)"

This should return "5.0.0" or higher. If the number is lower,
or if you see an error message, then your installation of K2fov is outdated.
