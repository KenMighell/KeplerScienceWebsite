Summary: The Kepler and K2 Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) data is now available online at MAST. This data contains the highest time sampling possible with Kepler, with integration times of 0.104 seconds and a median cadence of 30 seconds. 


The Kepler and K2 Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS) data is now available online at [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/kepler/fgs/). The FGS data consists of 44 unique Kepler stars and 51 unique K2 stars. Guide stars are used to keep the spacecraft pointing stable. Data from the guide stars is taken by four sensors in the corners of the focal plane. The FGS requires bright, quiet stars. These are measured much more often than the science targets, up to once every 0.104 seconds. The flux and centroid position is recorded with an average cadence of 30 seconds. 

The documentation on the FGS is available [here](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/fgs_doc_KSCI-19112.pdf), which details the way the FGS data is recorded. The data is available with centroid positions and flux computed on board Kepler. There are also Full Frame Images (FFI) available, however they were taken rarely during observations, approximately once per quarter or K2 campaign.

There is a short tutorial on reading in the FGS data from MAST [here](https://github.com/christinahedges/kepFGS). The tutorial shows how to read in the meta data of the guide stars, the FGS centroid and flux data and how to clean the light curve using simple routines designed to work with FGS. The raw data are available from [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/kepler/fgs/) with one file per module, per quarter containing all guide stars that were on the sensor.
