K2 Campaign 16 started successfully on December 7th
and has continued to proceed without issues since.

Because the Campaign is partially dedicated to the
[Supernova Experiment](/supernova-experiment),
the project has acquired PanSTARRS time to monitor
the entire field every other night in two filters
(rotating between g+r, g+i, and g+z)
for the purpose of providing early alerts for transients in the field.
The alerts are made public instantly via the 
[Transient Name Server](https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il),
where users can receive K2-specific alerts by signing up for the "KEGS-C16" alerts category.

During the first week of C16,
PanSTARRS has already identified two events in galaxies
which are currently being observed by Kepler:

* [2017iws](https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2017iws): a Type Ia supernova (z=0.09).
* [2017ixf](https://wis-tns.weizmann.ac.il/object/2017ixf): a Type II supernova (z=0.05).

Members of the community who wish to stay up to date
with this activity are encouraged to subscribe to the 
[K2 Supernova mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/k2sn). 
Note that several members of this list have signed up to a
[follow-up agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MKlyjkV8TQwwuUQiQtcrP_P9H3PWYDUjgbKVk37z19Q) which is intended to encourage collaboration.

The imaging data collected by PanSTARRS for K2 is expected to be released
to the public no later than June 1st, 2018.
The release will include images in g, r, i, and z
for the entire field to a typical depth of 21st magnitude
and with a typical cadence of 2 days in g and 6 days in r, i, z.
These PanSTARRS data are expected to benefit multiple galactic and extragalactic investigations associated with Campaign 16.
