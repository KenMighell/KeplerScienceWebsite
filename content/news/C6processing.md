Data processing for K2 Campaign 6 is now complete
and the pixel files are in the process of being shipped
to the [MAST archive](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data will become available to the public
by February 11, 2016.

The [Campaign 6 target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-6) included
28,289 standard long cadence and 84 short cadence targets.
In addition we observed 65 Trojan asteroids in long cadence. 

Keep an eye on this website for an announcement of the release
