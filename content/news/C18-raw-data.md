The raw data for K2 Campaign 18 were successfully downlinked
from the spacecraft and are now available for download from the
[K2 archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2). 

The use of the raw, uncalibrated data files requires an intimate understanding
of their format and caveats (see the [Kadenza tool](https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza)).
For nearly all scientific investigations, we recommend that users wait for the calibrated data products to become available later this year.
