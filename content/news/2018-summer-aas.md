Members of the Kepler/K2 team will staff a booth in the exhibit hall
at the upcoming Summer AAS meeting in Denver, Colorado.
You can find us at booth #309 which we share with our friends
from [NASA's Exoplanet Science Institute](http://nexsci.caltech.edu).

We will be able to update you about the Kepler spacecraft status,
answer your questions about the upcoming K2 Cycle 7 funding opportunity,
and demonstrate the [new lightkurve data analysis package](http://lightkurve.keplerscience.org).

You can also just pass by to grab a Kepler sticker!
