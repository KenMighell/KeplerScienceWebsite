The currently on-going [K2 Campaign 9](k2-c9.html) is dedicated to
a microlensing experiment,
aimed at simultaneously observing gravitional microlensing events with K2 and from Earth
in order to see a parallax effect in the shape and time of the lensing events.
To allow such events to be identified and characterized rapidly,
the raw data of this campaign are being released instantly
through the data archive at MAST.

The data obtained during the first half
of C9 (Apr 22 - May 18) are now available at
[https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/c9_raw_cadence_data](https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/c9_raw_cadence_data) 

The use of the level 1 data files requires an intimate understanding
of their structure, as documented in [KADN-26135](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/manuals/KADN-26315.pdf).
The Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office has released a tool to convert
these data into more traditional multi-extension image FITS files.
The tool, called "kadenza", is available and documented at
[https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza](https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza)

The traditional calibrated data products are scheduled to be processed
and released by September 26.
