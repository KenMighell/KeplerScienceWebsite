The pipeline-processed data for K2 Campaign 16
are now available for download
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).

The [target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-16) featured
20,647 stars alongside 9,241 galaxies for the 
<a href="supernova-experiment">supernova experiment</a></b>.


Highlights included the M44 (Beehive) and M67 clusters, 
dozens of exoplanets and exoplanet candidates revealed by K2 Campaign 5,
and many late-type flare stars observed in short cadence.

Uniquely, the spacecraft was pointing along the forward-facing direction
of the spacecraft's velocity vector during this Campaign,
which allowed the field to be accessed from Earth.
This enabled K2's single-bandpass photometry
to be complemented with [simultaneous observations from the ground](share-your-plan-for-k2-campaign-16-ancillary-observations.html).

The field contains two important clusters: <b>M44 (Beehive) and M67</b>.
M44 is one of the most nearby open clusters;
its members were observed using standard masks.
M67 is a benchmark cluster with solar-like age and metallicity;
the stars in its core were observed using a 400-by-360&nbsp;pixel
custom mask that covers the same area of the sky
that was previously covered by a 400-by-400&nbsp;pixel custom mask in Campaign 5,
except for a 40px-wide strip that is not on silicon in C16.
In addition, hundreds of members in the outskirts of M67
are being targeted using standard long cadence masks,
and 39 members are targeted using short cadence masks.
