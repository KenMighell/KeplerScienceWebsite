Title: K2 Cycle 6: Notable objects in Campaigns 17-18-19
Date: 2017-09-26 07:00
Author: Geert Barentsen

Proposals for targets to be observed by K2 in Campaigns 17, 18, and 19
are currently being solicited as part of [K2 Guest Observer Cycle 6](k2-proposing-targets.html),
with Phase 1 submissions due on **October 12, 2017**.

The [fields of these campaigns](k2-fields.html) 
will cover roughly 100 square degrees each towards the
constellations of Virgo (C17), Cancer (C18), and Aquarius/Pisces (C19).
To help inspire observing proposals,
we offer below a list of notable targets that will be visible
during these campaigns.

## Campaign 17

Campaign 17 (Mar 1 - May 8, 2018) will observe a forward-facing field
located towards the constellation of Virgo.
The high galactic latitude of this field (+55Â°) makes it ideally suited
to survey a large number of galaxies for the [K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment](supernova-experiment).
The field also provides a substantial overlap with Campaign 6,
offering a longer baseline for stellar activity, asteroseismology, and AGN studies,
as well as enabling dozens of known K2 planet candidates to be revisited.
The field also provides access to ~20 deg<sup>2</sup> of previously unexplored sky.

Notable objects which may be proposed include:

* **[Spica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spica)** (V=1): the brightest star in the constellation of Virgo, known to be a [rotating ellipsoidal variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_ellipsoidal_variable) with a period of four days.
* **[EQ Virginis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EQ_Virginis)** (V=9): a bright K-type flare star.
* **K2-41, K2-99, K2-110**: stars hosting confirmed planets discovered during K2 Campaign 6.
* **[RX J1347.5-1145](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RX_J1347.5-1145)**: one of the most massive galaxy clusters known.

## Campaign 18 

Campaign 18 (May 12 - Aug 2, 2018) will observe a backward-facing campaign dedicated to revisit Campaign 5 and substantially overlap Campaign 16.
The third visit to this key part of the sky that contains the M44 and M67 
clusters will enable users to study benchmark targets with a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle, enabling original Kepler-like science
at a Galactic sightline that is located 130 degrees away from the original Kepler field in Cygnus.
The field also provides access to more than one hundred previously-published K2 planets and planet candidates.

Notable objects which may be proposed include:

* **M67**: the benchmark open cluster with solar-like age and metallicity.
* **M44** (aka Praesepe or the Beehive): a 600 Myr-old open cluster revealed by K2 Campaign 5 to contain several planets.
* **HIP 41378** (V=9): a bright F-type dwarf previously discovered by K2 to host at least 5 planets.
* **K2-34, K2-95, K2-97, K2-98, K2-100, K2-101, K2-102, K2-103, K2-104, K2-105, K2-108, K2-114, K2-115**: additional stars hosting confirmed K2 planets.
* **[OJ 287](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OJ_287)** (V=15): a well-studied galaxy thought to show lightcurve variations due to a binary supermassive black hole at its center.

## Campaign 19


Campaign 19 (Aug 6 - Oct 10, 2018) will observe a forward-facing field near the constellation of Aquarius, partially overlapping Campaigns 3 and 12,
while also providing access to ~15 deg<sup>2</sup> of previously unstudied sky.

Notable objects which may be proposed include:

* **Neptune**: the planet.
* **TRAPPIST-1** (V=19): the well-known M dwarf known to host 7 Earth-sized planets.
* **GJ 9827** (V=10): a K-type dwarf [recently](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01527) [revealed](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01957) to host at least three transiting planets near the rocky/gaseous divide.
* **[HD 217107](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_217107)** (V=6): a bright G-type subgiant known to host two large RV planets.
* **Comet 2P/Encke** (V=20): a well-known periodic comet.

## Other candidate targets

In addition to the highlights listed above, Simbad lists a wealth of known objects that will be visible during these Campaigns. They include:

* 28,857 Galaxies;
* 1,979 known M dwarfs;
* 799 High Proper-Motion stars;
* 616 White Dwarfs;
* 462 RR Lyr Variables;
* 310 Active Galactic Nuclei;
* 204 (candidate) Brown Dwarfs;
* 44 Flare Stars;
* 21 Cataclysmic Variables.

A full table containing all Simbad sources that are visible in C17-18-19
can be downloaded from this website in CSV format ([K2-C17-C19-Simbad.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/master/simbad/K2-C17-C19-Simbad.csv)) or as a VOTable ([K2-C17-C19-Simbad.xml.gz](https://github.com/KeplerGO/K2FootprintFiles/raw/master/simbad/K2-C17-C19-Simbad.xml.gz)). Beware however that Simbad is not a full catalog of all known sources; it merely lists objects that have previously been discussed in the literature.
For the purpose of e.g. color-based target selections,
we recommend using a more complete source catalog such as the [EPIC](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php).

As a reminder, the [K2fov Python package](software.html#k2fov) enables you to test whether targets fall within a campaign field,
while its sister [K2ephem package](software.html#k2ephem)
allows moving Solar System bodies to be checked.
Note that Campaigns 17-18-19 require K2fov version 7.0 or higher to be installed.
