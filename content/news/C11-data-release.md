The pipeline-processed data for
[K2 Campaign 11](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-11)
are now available for download
from the [K2 archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2). 

As explained in more detail in the [data release notes](/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-11),
Campaign 11 was operationally separated into two segments,
C11a (23 days) and C11b (47 days),
as a result of a necessary roll correction
made 23 days after the start of the Campaign
to minimize solar torque on the spacecraft.
The C11a files are known in the archive under Campaign number 111,
and the C11b files have Campaign number 112.
A search for Campaign 11 will return both sets of files.

We strongly encourage users to read the [C11 data release notes](/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-11) carefully to understand
the implications of the roll correction, which is unique to C11.
