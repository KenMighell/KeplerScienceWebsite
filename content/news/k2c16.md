Proposals are currently being solicited for K2 GO Cycle 5.
 This cycle includes [Campaigns 14, 15, and 16](/k2-fields.html).
 Beyond the campaigns included in the current call, Campaign 17 is
 being planned as a supernova-centric campaign.  From recent estimates of the remaining fuel on the Kepler spacecraft,
 we anticipate that Campaign 17 is at risk.  In order to maximize the
 science return from the K2 mission, we are revising the position of the field for Campaign 16.
 Campaign 16 now involves the Kepler spacecraft observing in the +VV
(forward-facing) direction, which allows for simultaneous observations from K2 and
 from Earth and enables a supernova-focused campaign.  We anticipate
 that a large fraction of pixels in Campaign 16 will be
 dedicated to extragalactic targets in order to discover and
 characterize new supernovae.

With these changes to the Campaign 16 field, the
Step-1 and Step-2 proposal deadlines have been revised.  Step-1 proposals are now due by
23:59 EST ?? ??? 2016, and Step-2 proposals are due by 23:59 EST ??
??? 2016.  As a reminder, investigators may not submit a Step-2 proposal without first submitting a Step-1 proposal.

All investigators *must* update their version of the
<a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov target selection tool</a>
to account for the recent changes to Campaign 16. 

Information about the proposal process, including the scope, evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility, target selection tools, submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on the [proposal preparation page](/k2-proposing-targets.html).
