Proposals are currently being solicited for K2 GO Cycle 5.
 This cycle includes [Campaigns 14, 15, and 16](/k2-fields.html).
 Beyond the campaigns included in the current call, Campaign 17 is
 being planned as a forward-facing campaign, which involves the Kepler
 spacecraft observing in the +VV direction.  Observing in this mode
 allows for simultaneous observations from K2 and from Earth.  Just as
 Campaign 9 was a microlensing campaign, Campaign 17 is intended to have a unique focus.  Campaign
 17 will predominantly involve a search for supernovae, and the simultaneous observations from Earth
 enable the detailed characterization of the supernovae.  From recent estimates of the remaining fuel on the Kepler spacecraft,
 we anticipate that Campaign 17 is at risk. In order to maximize the
 science return from the K2 mission, we are revising the position of the field for Campaign 16.
 Campaign 16 will now involve the Kepler spacecraft observing in the
 forward-facing direction, and a significant fraction of pixels will
 be dedicated to a supernovae survey.  Proposals covering all other
 areas of astrophysics and planetary science are still encouraged for
 Campaign 16.

With these changes to the Campaign 16 field, the
Step 1 and Step 2 proposal deadlines have been revised.  Step 1 proposals are now due by
23:59 EST 03 November 2016, and Step 2 proposals are due by 23:59 EST
15 December 2016.  As a reminder, investigators may not submit a Step
2 proposal without first submitting a Step 1 proposal.

Proposers should only propose for
 targets that are on active silicon in the updated Campaign 16
 field.  All investigators *must* update their version of the
<a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov target selection tool</a>
to account for the recent changes to Campaign 16.  Note that the field
position is currently preliminary and will be finalized before the Step 1 deadline.

Information about the proposal process, including the scope, evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility, target selection tools, submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on the [proposal preparation page](/k2-proposing-targets.html).
