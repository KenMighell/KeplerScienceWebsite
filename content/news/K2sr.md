Today NASA announced that the K2 mission is officially extended, based on a recommendation from [NASA's Astrophysics Division's 2016 Senior Review](http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/2016-senior-review-operating-missions/) of operating missions.  The extension includes funding for three additional years plus a closeout period.  K2 science operations will therefore be covered beyond when the on-board fuel is fully depleted, anticipated to be sometime in 2018.

Details about the recommendation can be found in the [2016 Senior Review report](http://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/documents/).  In particular, the report noted that <b><i> "...with a very efficient GO program, the project includes worldwide participation covering every continent except Antarctica. The GO program is recognized as a major reason for the wealth of new scientific results." </i></b>
