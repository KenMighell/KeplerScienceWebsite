Proposals are now being solicited for the [K2 Guest Observer Cycle 4](http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={7A635D8E-1B2B-2488-5E0D-5C81471D150B}&path=open).  Cycle 4 includes [Campaigns 11, 12, and 13](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-fields.html).  The due date for Step-1 proposals is 23:59 EST February 5, 2016. Step-2 proposals are due by 23:59 EST March 4, 2016.  Investigators may not submit a Step-2 proposal without first submitting a Step-1 proposal by the due date. Proposers should be aware that the execution of the K2 GO Cycle 4 is contingent upon the outcome of the 2016 Senior Review.

Information about the proposal process, including the scope of the Guest Observer program, proposal evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility, target selection tools, the submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on the [proposal preparation page](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-proposing-targets.html).

Proposers should read the call carefully. We note here two major changes since Cycle 3:

1. Small proposals will now have a budget capped at $50,000, while Large proposals will be awarded up to $150,000.
2. An additional 0.5 pages is allowed in Large proposals to describe progress the proposers have made to delivering value-added community resources.

Technical questions regarding this program should be sent to <a href="keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov">keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov</a>.
