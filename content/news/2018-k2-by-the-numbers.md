During Campaigns 0 through 14,
the K2 mission has now targeted an estimated 297,991 objects, including
50,159 cool dwarf stars,
37,041 giant stars,
40,125 galaxies,
and 1,560 white dwarfs.
The flyer below, which was distributed at the recent Winter AAS meeting,
summarizes a few of these statistics.

These numbers will further increase upon the upcoming data releases
for Campaign 15 and 16 (expected by March and June).
We also note that the numbers do not include the very large number of objects observed
as part of the large "superstamps" collected towards the Galactic Bulge
and multiple clusters.

Although the flyer below is only a few weeks old,
the number of confirmed planets is already outdated:
**the K2 confirmed planets count surpassed 200 on February 5th and <a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html">currently stands at 212 planets</a>**.
