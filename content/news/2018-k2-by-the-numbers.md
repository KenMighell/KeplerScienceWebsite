During Campaigns 0 through 14,
the K2 mission has now targeted an estimated 297,991 objects, including
50,159 cool dwarf stars,
37,041 giant stars,
40,125 galaxies,
and 1,560 white dwarfs.
The flyer below, which was distributed at the recent Winter AAS meeting,
summarizes a few of these statistics.

These numbers will further increase upon the data releases
for Campaign 15 (expected in one month)
and Campaign 16 (expected by June).
Also note that the numbers do not include the very large number of objects observed
as part of the large "superstamps" collected towards the Galactic Bulge,
and several targeted clusters, including M8, M35, and M67,
for which the analysis is ongoing.

Although the flyer below is only a few weeks old,
the number of confirmed planets is already outdated:
the current K2 confirmed planets count <a href="https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/counts_detail.html">now stands at 197</a> and rises every week!
