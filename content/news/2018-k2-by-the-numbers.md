During Campaigns 0 through 14,
the K2 mission has now targeted an estimated 297,991 objects, including
50,159 cool stars,
37,041 giant stars,
40,125 galaxies,
and 1,560 white dwarfs.
The flyer below summarizes a few key statistics.

Note that the numbers do not include the very large number of objects observed
as part of the large "superstamps" collected towards the Galactic Bulge
and several clusters, including M35 and M67,
for which the analysis is ongoing.
Although the flyer is only a few weeks old, note that the number of confirmed planets is already outdated: the current count of K2 planets stands at 197!
