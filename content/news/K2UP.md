The K2 mission is developing a K2 Users' Panel (K2UP), whose role will be to represent the voice of the community in regards to mission policies, progress, and products.  Specifically, the panel will be expected to:

* provide input on data products and documentation from the mission
* review the mission's science balance for the remaining observing campaigns
* define what products are needed to preserve the legacy of the mission

The panel will communicate with the K2 Project Scientist, Project Manager, and Guest Observer Office a few times a year via telecon and/or in-person meetings held at NASA Ames Research Center or major conferences like the AAS winter meeting.  We anticipate members will serve on the K2UP for a term of at least one year.

Our goal is to form a panel consisting of 5-10 members that will have a first meeting via telecon in September 2016.  To ensure that the K2 community is adequately represented, we anticipate selecting members with expertise that covers all fields of astrophysics and planetary science.  If you are interested in participating in the K2UP, please contact us at <a href="keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov">keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov</a> by 31 July 2016.
