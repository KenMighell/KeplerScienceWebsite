The LCOGT (Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network) invites the whole astronomical community to celebrate the science from the first year of the NASA K2 mission in Santa Barbara, California. The meeting will take place November 2-5, 2015.

The organizers encourage K2 users to present early scientific results from all areas of research, from our own Solar System and exoplanets to young stars and distant galaxies.  Attendees will hear updates on the mission and discuss the latest in data processing techniques.  The organizers also encourage contributions on results from the Kepler prime mission and the future TESS mission.
