A new major version of [PyKE](http://pyke.keplerscience.org) has been released in beta. PyKE is Python-based set of data analysis tools which offer a user-friendly way to inspect and analyze the pixels and lightcurves obtained by Kepler and K2.

PyKE v3.0 provides the following key improvements::

* PyKE is now a [pip-installable](http://pyke.keplerscience.org/en/latest/install.html#installation) package and supports both Python 2 and 3;
* [tasks](http://pyke.keplerscience.org/en/latest/overview.html#tasks) are now available both as command-line tools and Python functions;
* PyKE no longer depends on PyRAF and is TESS-ready;
* the tutorials have been updated for K2 and the [documentation](http://pyke.keplerscience.org) is now generated using Sphinx;
* the development has been moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/KeplerGO/PyKE) to encourage [user contributions and bug reports](http://pyke.keplerscience.org/en/latest/contributing.html#contributing).

Interested users are encouraged to consult the documentation at [pyke.keplerscience.org](http://pyke.keplerscience.org), which includes a [quickstart tutorial](http://pyke.keplerscience.org/en/latest/quickstart.html).
