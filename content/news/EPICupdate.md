The K2 Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC), which is [hosted at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php), has been updated to include stellar classifications for 138,600 targets (~88% of all targets) in Campaigns 1-8.  The stellar properties were derived using colors, proper motions, spectroscopy, parallaxes, and galactic population synthesis models.  This update supports target selection for the various K2 Guest Observer programs and may be of particular interest for programs focused on transit searches or large asteroseismic studies.  For additional details on the updates to the EPIC, see [Huber et al. (2016)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..224....2H).  The updated stellar properties have also been ingested at the [ExoFOP](https://exofop.ipac.caltech.edu/k2/).
