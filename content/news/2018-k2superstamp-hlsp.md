The K2 Guest Observer office is excited to announce a new [High Level Science Products (HLSP)](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html) available at the 
MAST archive as of February. This HLSP-- called [K2Superstamp](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2superstamp/)-- consists of a series of FITS images for 
several clusters (M35, M67, Ruprecht 147, and the Lagoon Nebula) observed as superstamps. While the data for these regions have long been served on 
MAST, until now it was only available as smaller target pixel files (TPFs). With this new release, we have stitched the TPFs together into 
spatially contiguous images. In addition, each image has been fit with a highly accurate WCS solution, so that you may locate any object of interest via 
its right ascension and declination. The process of stitching and astrometric calibration is described in a [companion 
RNAAS article](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/aaac30/meta).

It is our hope that the release of these superstamp FITS images will spur further science, including new planet searches and variable star analyses.
Plans are afoot to release similar files for further superstamp regions observed by K2 (e.g., galaxies, globular clusters) in the future.
