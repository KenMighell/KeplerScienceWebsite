The raw cadence data for K2 Campaign 14 were successfully downlinked
from the spacecraft in the weekend of August 19th
and are now available for download from the
[K2 archive at MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2). 

The use of the raw, uncalibrated data files requires an intimate understanding
of their [format and caveats](raw-data-for-k2-campaign-12-and-trappist-1-now-available.html).
For nearly all scientific investigations,
we recommend that users wait for the calibrated products to become available.
Pipeline processing has started and the calibrated data products are expected
to become available in the course of October 2017.
