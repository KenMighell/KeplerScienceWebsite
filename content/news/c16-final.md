We [previously announced](/change-to-campaign-16-field-position-and-delay-to-go-cycle-5-deadline.html) that in order to maximize the science return from the remaining fuel, K2 Campaign 16 will now be a forward-facing campaign. This is to facilitate science that benefits from simultaneous observations from Earth.

We have now finalized the [position of this field](k2-fields.html). The field was positioned to maximize the number of known low-redshift galaxies, while also collecting significant fractions of both M67 and the Beehive cluster (aka Praesepe, M44). The campaign will begin around December 7, 2017 and last approximately 80 days. The field overlaps about 30% of the Campaign 5 field.

To determine whether targets fall on-silicon, all investigators must update their version of the
<a href="software.html#k2fov">K2fov target selection tool</a>
 and ensure they are using v6.0 or higher.

The new C16 EPIC catalog will be available at MAST within the next couple of weeks. The deadline for Step-1 proposals is November 3.
