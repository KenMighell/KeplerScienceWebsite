Reprocessed short cadence target pixel files for K2 Campaigns 3, 4, and 5
are now available for download 
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/).

This release, formally called 
[K2 Data Release 10](k2-pipeline-release-notes.html#data-release-10),
corrects the short cadence pixel calibration bug described in the [Global Erratum for Kepler Q0-Q17 & K2 C0-C5 Short-Cadence Data](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/KSCI-19080-002.pdf) (KSCI-19080).
Specific targets known to have their calibration improved by this reprocessing
are identifed in [the list of affected targets at the MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/catalogs/K2_scrambled_short_cadence_collateral_target_list.csv).

No other features of the files or the data processing have changed.
The long cadence data are unchanged.
As usual, this new release is documented by the
[K2 data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html) and
[K2 pipeline release notes](k2-pipeline-release-notes.html).

A release of reprocessed short cadence data for Kepler
is expected later this month, and a re-release of K2 Campaign 0-1-2 short cadence data is expected later this year.
