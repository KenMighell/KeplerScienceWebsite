The <b>Kepler/K2 workshop on Dwarf Stars and Clusters</b>, held from January 16 to 18, 2018
at Boston University was a smashing success! Despite the threat of a snowstorm, over 50 
attendees participated, giving exciting talks, sparking stimulating discussion, and forging new collaborations. 

PDF files of everyone's talk slides are now posted as links under the
<a href="https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/cluster-workshop/#agenda">agenda</a> listing.

A highlight of the workshop was the "unconference" held on the final day. Particpants hacked software,
wrangled with data, and planned for future observations, among other activities. The Kepler/K2 Guest 
Observer office is extremely greatful to Professor Philip Muirhead of BU and his colleagues for making
this event possible!
