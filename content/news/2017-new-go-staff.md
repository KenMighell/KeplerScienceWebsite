The Kepler/K2 Guest Observer Office has four new members joining us at Ames
Research Center in California: Michael Gully-Santiago, Ann Marie Cody,
Christina Hedges, and Zé Vinícius.

[Ann Marie Cody](http://annmariecody.com) earned her PhD at the California
Institute of Technology in 2011, where she investigated the properties of
young brown dwarfs and low-mass stars using time series photometry and
spectroscopy. Ann Marie will take a leading role in supporting the stellar
astrophysics community to mine the rich set of stellar clusters K2 has
observed in recent Campaigns, organize a K2 Cluster Science Workshop,
and help PI's deliver value-added High Level Science Products to the data
archive.

[Michael Gully-Santiago](https://gully.github.io) earned his PhD at the 
University of Texas in Austin in 2015 where he developed innovative 
technologies for and observational studies of star and planet formation.
Gully will take a leading role in supporting the K2 Supernova Cosmology
Experiment and helping our community leverage modern data science methods.

[Christina Hedges](http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~clh93/) recently submitted her
PhD at the University of Cambridge in the UK, researching exoplanet 
transmission spectroscopy using the Hubble Space Telescope and mining the K2
data using machine learning methods. Christina will take a leading role
supporting our exoplanet and asteroseismology community.

[Zé Vinícius](https://mirca.github.io) is an intern from the University of
Campina Grande in Brazil, where he is studying towards an Electrical
Engineering degree. Last year Zé implemented PSF photometry for the 
AstroPy/photutils project as part of a Google Summer of Code project. 
Zé will take a leading role in helping the GO office and the community produce
high-quality open source software tools and perform photometry in crowded
fields.

Zé started on March 1st, Michael and Ann Marie started on May 31st,
and Christina will join us at the end of June.
Together, the team will embark on an ambitious plan to leave behind a rich set
of community-oriented data products, tools, and tutorials to help current and
future astronomers extract the best possible science from Kepler and K2's
unique legacy data sets.
