Our US-based Kepler/K2 community is being alerted to the open call
for proposals to be submitted to NASA's
[Exoplanet Research Program (XRP)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId=%7B43CC37DF-3D91-E61A-2E57-63949390CE2C%7D&path=open).
Investigations are expected to directly support the goal
of understanding exoplanetary systems, by doing one or more of the following:

* detect exoplanets and/or confirm exoplanet candidates
in order to provide high-value targets
for current and future NASA observatories
or support NASA’s ongoing exoplanet surveys;
* observationally characterize exoplanets, their atmospheres,
or specific host star properties that directly impact our understanding
of the exoplanetary system, in order to support
NASA’s ongoing exoplanet surveys, inform target and operational choices
for current NASA missions, or deliver targeting, operational,
and formulation data for future NASA observatories;
* understand the chemical and physical processes of exoplanets
(including the state and evolution of their surfaces, interiors,
and atmospheres);
* improve understanding of the origins of exoplanetary systems. 

XRP proposals are solicitated annually as part of NASA's
[Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={E757EF32-60E6-76AE-A276-21A1F8BA96BB}&path=open)
solicitation.
Typical XRP funding amounts range between $60,000 to $200,000 per year,
and run typically for 2-3 years.

**Proposals for the 2017 call are due on Mar 30, 2017.**
