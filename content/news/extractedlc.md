A new MAST High Level Science Product from K2 has been delivered that includes extracted lightcurves. Courtesy of [Vanderburg and Johnson (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3853), long-cadence targets from Campaigns 0 and 1 now have detrended, extracted lightcurves available at MAST, including 20 different photometric apertures. There's a MAST Classic Search Interface so you can get lightcurves based on target IDs, coordinates, EPIC catalog fluxes, etc. You can also use our interactive plotter to explore the lightcurves using any of the photometric apertures before downloading the FITS files.
