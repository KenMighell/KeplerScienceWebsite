The [K2 Campaign 10 Data Release Notes](/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-10) are now available online.

We strongly encourage all users to review the notes to learn more about the
impact of the pointing offset,
which affected the first 6 days of the Campaign,
and the loss of Module 4,
which resulted in a 14-day data gap.

In addition, the [K2 Campaign 9 Data Release Notes](/k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-9)
have been updated to document a minor issue with the
Target Pixel File for EPIC-200070438.
