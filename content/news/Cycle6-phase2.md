The Kepler spacecraft continues to operate according to plan.
For this reason, we are now soliciting Phase-2 funding proposals for
the K2 Guest Observer Cycle 6.

**The due date for proposals is 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on April 19, 2018.**

Further information about the proposal process, including the scope,
evaluation criteria, availability of funds, eligibility,
submission process, and frequently asked questions, is detailed on the [proposal preparation page](/k2-proposing-targets.html).

While Phase-2 proposals are limited to use observations for targets which have
already already been selected to be observed during K2 Campaigns 17, 18, or 19,
we note that any team may submit a Phase-2 proposal using
any of the targets that appear on the <a href="k2-approved-programs.html">K2 approved targets & programs</a> page for these Campaigns,
i.e. a Phase-1 submission is not mandatory to qualify for Phase-2.
