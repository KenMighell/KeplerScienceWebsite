The K2 Mission and Boston University (BU) are convening
a small meeting from January 16 to 18, 2018, on the BU campus
in Boston, Massachusetts.

The event will highlight the diverse science that K2 has enabled
in the areas of cool stars and open clusters.
Topics will include stellar rotation and activity,
eclipsing binaries, young stellar objects, and planets in clusters. 

The [workshop website](/cluster-workshop) contains further details,
including the [registration form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZhetqWv9_oUAXmLueHDhyIVdMYcLPj53p5TjPeEgTTMkRWQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).
There is no fee to attend. 

**The deadline for submitting a talk is November 22nd.**
We expect to give most participants who meet this deadline
the opportunity to give a talk.
