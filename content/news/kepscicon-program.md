The Kepler & K2 Science Conference IV was held
at the NASA Ames Research Center on June 19â€“23, 2017.
The conference was live-streamed and talks were recorded via Adobe
Connect. These recordings have now been made available online [via the conference webpage](scicon4/#conference-agenda).

In order to view the talks,
you will need to have the "Adobe Connect Add-In" installed.
Most browsers should be able to access these talks,
but we have found Firefox to be the most user-friendly browser for the plug-in to work.

As a reminder, photos and impressions of the conference can also be accessed
via the [#KeplerSciCon hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23KeplerSciCon)
on Twitter.
