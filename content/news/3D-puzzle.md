With the help of the [NASA Ames SpaceShop Rapid Prototyping Facility](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/spaceshop/home),
the Kepler team has created a 3D-printable puzzle of the spacecraft
for educational purposes.

The model files and documentation are available on our
GitHub repository at [https://github.com/KeplerGO/kepler-3d-printing-model](https://github.com/KeplerGO/kepler-3d-printing-model). 
We would love to hear about your experiences
if you decide to use this resource for educational or outreach purposes,
