With the help of the [NASA Ames SpaceShop Rapid Prototyping Facility](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/spaceshop/home),
the Kepler team has created a 3D-printable puzzle of the spacecraft
(pictured below).
The model files and documentation are available on our
GitHub repository at [https://github.com/KeplerGO/kepler-3d-printing-model](https://github.com/KeplerGO/kepler-3d-printing-model). 

The puzzle was created for educational purposes,
and as such the model files were scaled and simplified for durability where appropriate. 
If you decide to use this resource for educational purposes,
we would love to hear about your experiences.
