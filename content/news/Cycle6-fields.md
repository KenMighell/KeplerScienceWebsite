The K2 mission has selected the fields
that will be observed as part of Campaigns 17, 18, and 19.
The fields were selected based on a review of the feedback received
as part of a [recent solicitation for community input](/request-for-input-on-the-campaign-17-and-18-field-placement.html),
whilst also taking into account the spacecraft's engineering constaints
and fuel usage.

<b>Campaign 17</b> (Mar 1 - May 8, 2018) will observe a forward-facing field located near the constellation of Virgo. The high galactic latitude of this field makes it ideally suited to enable the [K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment](/supernova-experiment) to continue, leveraging ground-based resources already put in place for Campaign 16. The field also provides a substantial overlap with Campaign 6, offering a longer baseline for AGN, stellar activity, and seismology studies, whilst also enabling dozens of known K2 planet candidates to be revisited.
The field also provides access to ~20 deg<sup>2</sup> of previously unexplored sky.

<b>Campaign 18</b> (May 12 - Aug 2, 2018) will be a backward-facing campaign dedicated to an exact revisit of Campaign 5, and a partial overlap with Campaign 16. The third visit to this key part of the sky that contains M44 and M67 will enable users to study targets with a 3-year baseline and 8-month duty cycle, enabling original Kepler-like science at a Galactic sightline that is 130 degrees away from the original Kepler field in Cygnus.
Alongside M44 and M67, the field provides access to HIP 41378 (a 5-planet system around a 9th magnitude star), and more than one hundred previously-published K2 planet candidates.

<b>Campaign 19</b> (Aug 6 - Oct 10, 2018) will observe a forward-facing field near the constellation of Aquarius, partially overlapping Campaigns 3 and 12, whilst also providing access to ~15 deg<sup>2</sup> of previously unstudied sky. The field includes planet Neptune, Comet 2P/Encke, and the Trappist-1 system.

<b>These fields will constitute the K2 GO Cycle 6 program. A call for target and funding proposals to be submitted to this program is expected to be issued in July as part of NASA ROSES, with a Step-1 deadline expected to follow in October.</b>
