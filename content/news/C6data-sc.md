Short cadence target pixel files for K2 Campaign 6
are now available for download 
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/).

Whilst data for 28,289 long cadence targets in C6
were already released two weeks ago,
the data for the 84 short cadence targets were delayed slightly to allow the
[short cadence pixel calibration issue](problem-with-kepler-and-k2-short-cadence-pixel-calibration.html) to be resolved.

We strongly encourage users to read the
[Campaign 6 data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-6).
