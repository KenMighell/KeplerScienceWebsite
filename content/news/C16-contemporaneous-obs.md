K2 Campaign 16 will be "forward-facing", making possible contemporaneous ground-based observations from Earth.  Many of these ground-based observations will provide polychromatic photometry in support of the [K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment](/supernova-experiment.html), as well as a diversity of science projects including simultaneous exoplanet transit observations and stellar rotation/activity/jitter studies.  Some of these ancillary data will be made publicly available, and can be repurposed for other K2 targets.  To aid in resource sharing, the K2 Guest Observer Office is crowdsourcing a Google Doc of planned observations targeting the C16 field.
