Date: 2017-08-01 16:00
Author: Geert Barentsen

The source code for the official Kepler data processing pipeline
has been released to the public under the NASA Open Source License,
and made available for download via the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/nasa/kepler-pipeline](https://github.com/nasa/kepler-pipeline).

The release is accompanied by a [Source Code Roadmap](https://github.com/nasa/kepler-pipeline/raw/master/kscrm.pdf) (pdf)
which presents an overview of the various pipeline components
found in the source code directory tree.

Users interested in the development of the underlying algorithms
should refer to the [Kepler Data Processing Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/manuals/KSCI-19081-002-KDPH.pdf) (pdf) which, together with the source code,
represents the documentation of the algorithms used
to produce the final data products of Kepler's prime mission.
Products generated for the K2 mission use a modified version of this pipeline.
