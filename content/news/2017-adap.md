The Kepler/K2 community is being alerted to the new call for proposals
to be submitted to the [Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={9B644CB9-C0A8-8F23-DE92-FA3837D2F0BD}&path=open), which provides financial support for US-based investigations
whose primary purpose is the analysis of NASA space astrophysics data
that are archived in the public domain at the time of proposal submission.

ADAP proposals are solicitated annually as part of NASA's
[Research Opportunities in Space and Earth Sciences (ROSES)](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={E757EF32-60E6-76AE-A276-21A1F8BA96BB}&path=open) solicitation.
Typical ADAP funding amounts range between $40,000 per year
to more than $200,000 per year, and can run for up to 3 years.

Proposals for the 2017 call are due on May 16, 2017.
All Kepler/K2 data that will have been released to the community as of 
that date will be eligible for inclusion in ADAP proposals.
This includes all Kepler prime mission data and K2 Campaigns 0 through 10.

Studies of bodies within our Solar System based on Kepler/K2 data
are not eligible for funding under the ADAP.
These are eligible for funding through the [DDAP program](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={410D2803-9FFE-F7D0-2CDA-6AABC9664AF5}&path=open) instead.
