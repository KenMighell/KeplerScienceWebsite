As previously reported, Kepler Q2--Q16, data release 24, short-cadence data was calibrated incorrectly, making it unsuitable for use in projects requiring high photometric precision.  This is described in [this erratum](http://archive.stsci.edu/kepler/release_notes/release_notes24/KSCI-19064-002a-DRN24err.pdf).  As a service to the community, the NASA Exoplanet Archive has made available the short cadence data that were released prior to DR24. Only the original FITS files are available and the data release number varies by quarter; see the header keyword DATA\_REL. The data may be obtained from NExScI by using this [wget script](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/bulk_data_download/wget_all_prior_SC.bat).
