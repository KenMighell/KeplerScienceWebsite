The K2 Mission and Boston University (BU) are convening
a small workshop on Dwarf Stars and Clusters with K2,
to take place from January 16 to 18, 2018, on the BU campus
in Boston, Massachusetts.

The event will highlight the diverse science that K2 has enabled
in the areas of cool stars and open clusters.
Topics will include stellar rotation and activity,
eclipsing binaries, young stellar objects, and planets in clusters. 

The [workshop website](/cluster-workshop) contains further details,

We will be soliciting talks until November 22nd; most participants will have an opportunity to give a 
brief presentation on a topic of their choice.
