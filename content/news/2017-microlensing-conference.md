The 21st International Microlensing Conference—entitled "Ushering in the New Age of Microlensing from Space"—will take place on February 1–3, 2017, in Pasadena, California.

The conference intends to highlight breaking results from [K2's Campaign 9](/k2-c9.html), a combined ground- and space-based microlensing survey that was carried out using the Kepler spacecraft this summer.
The conference will also feature results from other space- and ground-based 
microlensing surveys, and will be preceded by a free half-day workshop featuring a series of introductory microlensing talks.
