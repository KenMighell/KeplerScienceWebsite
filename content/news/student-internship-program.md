of a major NASA mission.

The internships are based at Kepler/K2's mission headquarters
at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California.

Example projects we can offer include:

* Designing an interactive web application to compute Kepler’s planet occurrence rates, or to visualize K2’s planet discoveries.
* Searching the Kepler/K2 data for unknown asteroids and comets.
* Assisting the quality control of new data releases by improving the [k2-quality-control software](https://github.com/KeplerGO/k2-quality-control).
* Mining the Kepler/K2 literature and producing enhanced publication statistics using the [kpub software](https://github.com/KeplerGO/kpub).
* Writing Kepler/K2 data analysis tutorials.
* etc...

Due to the technical nature of these projects, 
candidates are expected to present evidence
of strong and relevant computing skills,
such as Python, AstroPy, GitHub, Linux, and/or web development.

Interested participants should submit a <2-page proposal
to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov)
outlining their skills, ambitions, and period of availability. 
Candidates may be eligible to receive lodging and a stipend
