The Oxford Exoplanets group announces the [release at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sc/) of a new set of K2 light curve [High Level Science Products](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html). The Oxford group has applied the [K2 Systematics Correction (K2SC)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1093/mnras/stw706) Gaussian Process-based detrending algorithm to project generated long-cadence light curves from Campaigns 3 to 6. This algorithm simultaneously models astrophysical variability and pointing systematics, enabling the user to disentangle the two and remove either or both. These light curves are therefore well-suited to searches for transits and other short-lived events in the light curves of variable active stars, or to studying stellar variability. Additional campaigns will be added as the data becomes available and the source code is [available from Github](https://github.com/OxES/k2sc).

This release complements the K2 data already hosted at the MAST, which includes the [project generated data products](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/), and community generated [High Level Science Products](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html).
