In order to maximize the science return from K2 using the remaining fuel,
the mission has decided to change the position of the field for Campaign 16
and to delay the upcoming K2 Cycle 5 deadline by about a month. 

A formal announcement with details on the new field and the new proposal deadlines will be forthcoming in the next few days.
