Title: DDT deadline for K2 Campaign 17 approaching 
Date: 2017-11-14 22:00
Author: Geert Barentsen

A small percentage of the available K2 pixels in each campaign may be
allocated by the K2 Guest Observer (GO) Office Director
as Director's Discretionary Targets (DDTs).
The primary utilization of DDT programs is in support
of community-proposed requests that are based on
exceptional, time-critical observing opportunities that cannot be
accommodated with the regular cycle of Calls for Proposals for K2.

We are currently accepting DDT proposals for Campaign 17, 18, and 19.
The proposals are due by 23:59 PT (Pacific Time) on the
following dates: 

* Campaign 17: Nov 30, 2017
* Campaign 18: Jan 19, 2018
* Campaign 19: Apr 12, 2018

For further information on the DDT program and the requirements
for proposal submission,
[consult the DDT web page](k2-ddt.html).
Proposals should be submitted via email to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](mailto:keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov).
