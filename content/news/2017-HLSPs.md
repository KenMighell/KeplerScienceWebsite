The K2 communinity has been very active in working with the mission's images and light curves, and a number of groups have made 
their output available to the public in the form of High Level Science Products. We are happy to report updates to several of these 
submissions over the last 6 months. The K2 Mission encourages further submissions of HLSPs and our Guest Observer Office is happy 
to help astronomers interface with the MAST archive.

This month, the [K2 Systematics Correction](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sc/) ("K2SC") by Aigrain et al. is celebrating the 
release of version 2, with light curves now available through Campaign XX. These data products provide time series detrended for 
positional jitter and/or time-dependent systematics. As such, they are well suited to studying variable stars. 

In addition, as of July 26, the [K2SFF](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff/) data produced by Vanderburg & Johnson now include 
Campaign 11 light curves.

[POLAR](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/polar/), a new High Level Science Product was made available in March by Barros et al. 
POLAR consists of K2 light curves derived from photometric apertures optimized for bright stars. The light curves have
been detrended for position-dependent systematic effects, and the group has provided a list of possible planet transits
selected from this data. 

Finally, in February, [version 2.0 of EVEREST](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest/) was released, including Campaigns 0 
through 8. The update now, detailed in Luger et al. (2017), includes light curves for short cadence and saturated targets. 
Precision has improved over version 1.0, with photometric performance now equivalent to that of the Kepler main mission for stars 
down to Kp=14.
