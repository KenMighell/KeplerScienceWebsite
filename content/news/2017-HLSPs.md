The project encourages members of our community to share and archive
value-added data products derived from Kepler or K2 observations
via the [High Level Science Products (HLSP)](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html) service offered by the data archive at MAST.

In recent months, four teams have released or updated
the data products they share with the community in this way:

* As of this month, the second version of the **[K2 Systematics Correction](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sc/) (K2SC)** light curves
prepared by [Aigrain et al.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.459.2408A)
has been made available.
The K2SC pipeline aims to preserve astrophysical signals by modeling
both spacecraft systematics and stellar variability at the same time.
Version 2.0 incorporates Campaigns 7, 8, and 10 for the first time,
includes a re-processing of Campaigns 3-6,
and fixes the "cadence" and "quality" columns which were affected by a glitch in version 1.0.

* As of July, the **[K2 Self-Flat-Fielding (K2SFF)](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff/)** light curves prepared by [Vanderburg & Johnson](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014PASP..126..948V) have been updated.
The K2SFF algorithm correlates flux measurements
with the spacecraft's pointing to remove the motion-induced systematics.
The latest update adds Campaign 11 light curves to the existing set which already included Campaigns 0 through 10.

* As of March, the **[Planet candidates from OptimaL Aperture Reduction (POLAR)](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/polar/)** light curves and planet candidates prepared by [Barros et al.](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...594A.100B) have been made available for Campaigns 1 through 6.
POLAR is a new product optimized for bright stars
which are suitable for spectroscopic follow-up.

* As of February, version 2.0 of the **[EPIC Variability Extraction and Removal for Exoplanet Science Targets (EVEREST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest/)** light curves was released.
The update, detailed in [Luger et al. (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1702.05488),
provides light curves for Campaigns 0 through 8,
and includes short cadence and saturated targets for the first time.
EVEREST's photometric performance is claimed to be equivalent to that of Kepler's main mission for stars down to Kp=14.

More details on each of these data products, including a more detailed description and a list of references, is available via the [K2 High Level Science Product page at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html).

Additional teams are encouraged to make their data products available
in the same way. In particular, large programs funded via the K2 Guest Observer program are reminded of the requirement to develop and disseminate a value-added community resource product at the end of the performance period.

The [project's helpdesk](helpdesk.html) is available to help guide the delivery of new data products and connect authors with the archives.
