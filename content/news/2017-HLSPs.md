The K2 community has been very active in working with the mission's images and light curves, and a number of groups have made 
their output available to the public in the form of High Level Science Products. We are happy to report updates to several of these 
submissions over the last 6 months. The K2 Mission encourages further submissions of HLSPs and our Guest Observer Office is available
to help astronomers interface with the MAST archive.

This month, Aigrain et al. are making available version 2 of the [K2 Systematics Correction](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sc/) 
("K2SC"). These data products provide time series detrended for positional jitter and/or time-dependent systematics. As such, they are 
intended to be well suited for the study of variable stars. Version 2.0 fixes the "cadence" and "quality" columns in the FITS files to 
be 32-bit integers. The previous Version 1.0 had these defined as 16-bit integers, thus making them not usable. Version 2.0 also 
includes a re-processing of Campaigns 3-6, and additionally incorporates Campaigns 7, 8, and 10 for the first time.

Similarly, as of July 26, the [K2SFF](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/k2sff/) data produced by Vanderburg & Johnson now include 
Campaign 11 light curves.

[POLAR](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/polar/), a new High Level Science Product was made available in March by Barros et al. 
POLAR consists of K2 light curves derived from photometric apertures optimized for bright stars. The light curves have
been detrended for position-dependent systematic effects, and the group has provided a list of possible planet transits
selected from this data. 

Finally, in February, [version 2.0 of EVEREST](https://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/everest/) was released, including Campaigns 0 through 
8. The update, detailed in Luger et al. (2017), now includes light curves for short cadence and saturated targets. Precision has 
improved over version 1.0, with photometric performance claimed to be equivalent to that of the Kepler main mission for stars down to 
Kp=14.

More details on each K2 High Level Science Product are available at [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/hlsps.html). Each HLSP
page has a description of its intended uses, publication(s) to consult, the data contents, and several methods to access the data.
