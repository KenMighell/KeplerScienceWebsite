Pipeline processing for K2 Campaign 9 is now complete
and the data are in the process of being shipped
to the [MAST archive](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data will become available for download
on or before September 30.

The majority of the Campaign 9 pixel budget was dedicated to a 3.7 degÂ²
superstamp toward the Galactic bulge, designed to search for gravitational microlensing events.
Owing to the unique nature of this data set, the C9 data release will
only contain target pixel files.
High-level derived products, such as lightcurves, are expected to be released by the [C9 science team](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/k2-c9.html) at a later date.

Keep an eye on this website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).
