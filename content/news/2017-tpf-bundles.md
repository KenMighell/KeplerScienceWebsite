Users seeking to obtain a copy of every single Target Pixel File (TPF)
for a given K2 Campaign may now retrieve the data in "bundles" of
tar archive files from the following url at MAST:

[http://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/target_pixel_files/bundles/](http://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/target_pixel_files/bundles/)

By grouping the TPFs into larger bundles, users will tend to experience faster data transfers and have a more convenient way of verifying that all files have been transfered. See the README file in the directory for more information.
Warning: the K2 pixel data amounts to more than 3 terabyte!
