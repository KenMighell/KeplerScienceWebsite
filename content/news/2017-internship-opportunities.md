The Kepler/K2 Science Center at NASA Ames is now
[accepting applications](https://intern.nasa.gov/ossi/web/public/guest/searchOpps/index.cfm?solarAction=view&id=28643)
for paid internships via the
[NASA Internships Portal](https://intern.nasa.gov/ossi/web/public/guest/searchOpps/index.cfm?solarAction=view&id=28643).
The program enables students to gain experience in the scientific operations
of a high-profile space photometry mission.
PhD and graduate students already using Kepler or K2 data
as part of their research projects are particularly encouraged to apply.
We encourage interested applicants to contact [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov) before applying.

Also at NASA Ames, the [NASA Postdoctoral Program](https://npp.usra.edu/)
is accepting applications to work on [high-resolution imaging of Kepler and K2 exoplanet host stars](https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/details/?ro=19108) with Steve Howell, [the analysis of Kepler's exoplanet populations](https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/details/?ro=18912) with Natalie Batalha,
and [the analysis of transiting planets to be observed by JWST](https://npp.usra.edu/opportunities/details/?ro=19114) with Tom Greene.
Interested applicants are encouraged to contact the advisor before applying.
