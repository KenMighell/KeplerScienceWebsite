The currently on-going [K2 Campaign 10](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-10) includes targeted observations of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko,
the comet currently being studied by the [ESA Rosetta Mission](http://rosetta.esa.int).

To provide members of the Rosetta science team with fast access to the data,
the uncalibrated level 1 files for Campaign 10 will be made available immediately after downlink on or near September 26.
They will be accessible from a public directory at
[https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/c10_raw_cadence_data](https://archive.stsci.edu/pub/k2/c10_raw_cadence_data).

The use of the level 1 files requires an intimate understanding
of their structure, as documented in [KADN-26135](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/manuals/KADN-26315.pdf).
The Kepler/K2 GO Office has released a tool to convert the level 1 data into uncalibrated FITS images for quicklook purposes.
The tool, called "kadenza", is available and documented at
[https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza](https://github.com/KeplerGO/kadenza).

The traditional calibrated data products for Campaign 10 will be released,
as usual, when they are ready â€” approximately 2 to 3 months after the end of the Campaign.
