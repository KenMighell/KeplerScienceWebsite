The science program and target lists for K2 Campaign 11 (Sep 24 - Dec 8)
have now been posted on the [approved targets & programs page](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-11).

The C11 target list includes 14,209 standard long cadence and 65 standard short cadence targets. The number of targets is lower than usual because it is a function of the spacecraft's on-board compression efficiency, which is low in the crowded Galactic Bulge field
targeted by this Campaign.

This is the first campaign to be executed after the <a href='/retirement-of-ccd-module-4-confirmed.html'>loss of CCD Module 4</a>.
Targets that were approved but would have fallen on this module were excluded from the target list.
Only five programs lost more than 10% of their targets as a result,
and no program lost more than 20%.

In addition to the standard targets, we will observe 11 very bright stars (Kp magnitudes 3 to 6) by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed. Two of the bright stars are observed in short cadence (26 Oph &amp; 36 Oph; IDs 200129034 &amp; 200129035) and nine in long cadence (IDs 200128906–200128914).

We also gained efficiency by tiling five globular clusters which contained a high density of targets requested by multiple programs.
These clusters are M9, M19, NGC 6293, NGC 6355, and Terzan 5.  The latter three clusters will be observed using a circular aperture with 1.6' radius, whilst M9 was targeted using a 2' radius aperture, and M19 will be targeted using a 3'-by-5' rectangular mask covering only the part of the cluster that falls on silicon.
Each cluster was tiled using a series of masks with the following ID ranges:  
<ul>
<li>200126982–200127109 (M9)</li>
<li>200126870–200126870 (M19)</li>
<li>200127326–200127413 (NGC 6293)</li>
<li>200127414–200127501 (NGC 6355)</li>
<li>200128019–200128100 (Terzan 5)</li>
</ul>

Finally, we will also observe 55 Trojan asteroids (IDs 200107039–200128905), 7 Trans-Neptunian Objects (200114742–200125326), and Saturn's moons Titan and Enceladus (200128938–200129033 &amp; 200124091–200124403).
The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips. The ID ranges for these objects are:
<ul>
<li>200107039–200128905 (Trojans)</li>
<li>200114742–200125326 (TNOs)</li>
<li>200128938–200129033 (Titan)</li>
<li>200124091–200124403 (Enceladus)</li>
</ul>
