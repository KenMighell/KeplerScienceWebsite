The science program and target lists for K2 Campaign 11 (Sep 24 - Dec 8)
have now been posted on the [approved targets & programs page](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-11).

The C11 target list includes <b>14,209 standard long cadence</b> and <b>65 standard short cadence</b> targets.
The number of targets is lower than usual because it is a function of the spacecraft's on-board compression efficiency, which is low in the crowded Galactic Bulge field targeted by this Campaign.

We gained efficiency by tiling <b>five globular clusters—M9, M19, NGC 6293, NGC 6355, and Terzan 5</b>—which contained a high density of targets requested by multiple programs.
The latter three clusters will be observed using a circular aperture with 1.6' radius, whilst M9 was targeted using a 2' radius aperture, and M19 will be targeted using a 3'-by-5' rectangular aperture because it fell only partially on silicon.
Each cluster was tiled using a series of masks with the following ID ranges:  
<ul>
<li>200126982–200127109 (M9)</li>
<li>200126870–200126870 (M19)</li>
<li>200127326–200127413 (NGC 6293)</li>
<li>200127414–200127501 (NGC 6355)</li>
<li>200128019–200128100 (Terzan 5)</li>
</ul>

The target list also includes <b>11 very bright stars</b> (Kp magnitudes 3 to 6) for which we target only the central region of pixels using a circular aperture mask, excluding the long saturation bleed.
Two of the bright stars are observed in short cadence (26 Oph &amp; 36 Oph) and
the others in long cadence. Their target IDs are:
<ul>
<li>200129034 (26 Oph)</li>
<li>200129035 (36 Oph)</li>
<li>200128906 (θ Oph)</li>
<li>200128907 (44 Oph)</li>
<li>200128908 (45 Oph)</li>
<li>200128909 (51 Oph)</li>
<li>200128910 (ο Oph)</li>
<li>200128911 (HR 6472)</li>
<li>200128912 (HR 6365)</li>
<li>200128913 (HR 6366)</li>
<li>200128914 (191 Oph)</li>
</ul>

Finally, we will also observe <b>55 Trojan asteroids</b>, <b>7 Trans-Neptunian Objects</b>, and Saturn's moons <b>Titan and Enceladus</b>.
The trajectories of these moving bodies have been tiled using 1xn or nx1 pixel strips. The ID ranges for these objects are:
<ul>
<li>200107039–200128905 (Trojans)</li>
<li>200114742–200125326 (TNOs)</li>
<li>200128938–200129033 (Titan)</li>
<li>200124091–200124403 (Enceladus)</li>
</ul>

Note that this is the first campaign to be executed after the <a href='/retirement-of-ccd-module-4-confirmed.html'>loss of CCD Module 4</a>.
Targets that were approved but would have fallen on this module were excluded from the target list.
Only five programs lost more than 10% of their targets as a result,
and no program lost more than 20%.
