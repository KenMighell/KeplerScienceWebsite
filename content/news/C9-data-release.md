Target pixel files, full frame images, and thruster firing lists for
K2 Campaign 9 are now available for download from the
[MAST archive](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2). The C9 data release notes
are available [here](k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-9). 

C9 was largely dedicated to a search for gravitational microlensing
events in a region around the Galactic bulge. A variety of other
targets were also observed through the K2 [Director's Discretionary Target](k2-ddt.html) program.
These include  O-type stars,the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar, and the Lagoon
star-forming region (M8).  The complete list of observed targets can
be found [here](k2-approved-programs.html).

Due to the unique operations for this campaign, the C9
data release only contains Type-1 target pixel files and does not
include light curves. Also, the campaign was split into two halves (C9a
and C9b), with a data downlink taking place in between C9a and C9b to maximize
data collection capabilities as well as introduce a ~0.6 pixel
offset.  Archive products are therefore identified as being from
either C9a or C9b using the identifier c91 or c92, respectively. We strongly encourage users interested in C9 data
to review the
[data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html#k2-campaign-9) in detail.
