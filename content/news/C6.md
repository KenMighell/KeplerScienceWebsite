The K2 [Campaign 6 Target List](/k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-6) has now been posted. This target list consists of 28,289 standard long cadence and 84 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over 65 Trojan Asteroids. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled the just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans move along. These observations are in long cadence. These observations are due to start in early-July.
