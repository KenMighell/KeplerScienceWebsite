Author: Geert Barentsen

A small percentage of the available K2 pixels in each campaign may be
allocated by the K2 Guest Observer (GO) Office Director as Director's
Discretionary Targets (DDTs). The primary utilization of DDT programs
is in support of community-proposed requests that are based on
exceptional, time-critical observing opportunities that cannot be
accommodated with the regular cycle of Calls for Proposals for K2.

We are currently accepting DDT proposals for Campaigns 15
and 16. The proposals are due by 23:59 PT (Pacific Time) on the
following dates: 

* May 18, 2017 for Campaign 15
* August 31, 2017 for Campaign 16

For further information on the DDT program and the requirements
for proposal submission,
[check out the DDT website](k2-ddt.html). Proposals should be
submitted via email to [keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov](mailto:keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov).
