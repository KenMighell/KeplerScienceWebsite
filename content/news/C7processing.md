Data processing for K2 Campaign 7 is now complete
and the pixel files are in the process of being shipped
to the [MAST archive](http://archive.stsci.edu/k2).
We anticipate that the data will become available to the public shortly.

The [Campaign 7 target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-7) included
13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. 
In addition we tiled large masks to observe the open cluster Ruprecht 147,
dwarf planet Pluto, and 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids.

Keep an eye on this website for an announcement of the release
and the associated [data release notes](k2-data-release-notes.html).
