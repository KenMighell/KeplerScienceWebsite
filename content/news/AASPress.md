The K2 mission is well into its second year of operations and is routinely producing exciting and significant science.  The prime Kepler mission also continues to yield scientifically significant results from its four-year-long observations of the Cygnus-Lyra region. While we consider each scientific result to be critical to the legacy of both Kepler and K2, some results are of particular interest to the public (e.g., an exoplanet orbiting in the habitable zone of a nearby star, or stars with unique flux variations that spark a public conversation on alien megastructures.) 

If you are attending AAS in January and presenting new results from either K2 or Kepler that you think will particularly appeal to the public, let us know if we can help bring attention to your work. In particular, if you have a science result that may have public appeal and will soon be accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, please contact [Michele Johnson](mailto:michele.johnson@nasa.gov).
