Long cadence target pixel files and light curves for K2 Campaign 6
are now available for download 
from the [K2 data archive at MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/k2/).

The short cadence data will follow in approximately two weeks,
to allow the [pixel calibration issue that we described last week](problem-with-kepler-and-k2-short-cadence-pixel-calibration.html) to be resolved.

The [Campaign 6 target list](k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-6)
contained 28,289 long cadence and 84 short cadence targets.
We also included large pixel masks to cover the trajectories
of 65 Trojan Asteroids.

Detailed data release notes are expected to be available shortly
and will be linked from this post.
