Title: Kepler and K2 Project Deliveries
Save_as: data-releases.html

[TOC]

There are two archives for *official* Kepler and K2 data products -
the [Exoplanet Archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)
which is hosted at the
[NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI)](http://nexsci.caltech.edu/)
and the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/) which is located at the [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](http://www.stsci.edu/). The Exoplanet Archive primarily hosts data related to the Kepler mission planet search while the MAST is responsible for hosting time series data and spacecraft calibration products for Kepler and K2.
