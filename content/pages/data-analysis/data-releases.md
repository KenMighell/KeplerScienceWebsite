[TOC]

There are two archives for *official* Kepler and K2 data products -
the [Exoplanet Archive](http://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/)
which is hosted at the
[NASA Exoplanet Science Institute (NExScI)](http://nexsci.caltech.edu/)
and the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/) which is located at the [Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)](http://www.stsci.edu/). The Exoplanet Archive primarily hosts data related to the Kepler mission planet search while the MAST is responsible for hosting time series data and spacecraft calibration products for Kepler and K2.

## Full-Frame Images (FFIs)

The Kepler detector is a photometer with an array of 42 CCDs. The
Kepler field of view spans 115.6 square degrees over 95 million
detector pixels, with a 3.98 x 3.98 arcsec pixels and 3.1-7.5 arcsec
FWHM imaging point spread function. The Kepler field contains 10
million stars brighter than the confusion limit of 20-21 mag. The
field of view and pixel scale were designed to maximize the number of
resolvable stars brighter than $Kp = 15. Science data downloads occur
approximately once per month when Kepler must leave the field
temporarily to point its high-gain antenna towards Earth. Immediately
before each data download, a 29.4 min image of the entire field of
view is collected and transmitted. These are the FFIs. FFIs are
delivered to the public as soon as calibration is complete and they
can be downloaded from a dedicated data retrieval page at MAST.

FFI data format is defined in section 2.3.3 of the Kepler Archive
Manual. Resources for inspecting and analyzing the FFIs are provided
here. A quick tour of an FFI file is here.

## Target Pixel Files (TPFs)

The Kepler camera takes one exposure every 6.5s. Exposures are summed onboard and stored at either 1765.5 s (29.4 min) cadence or 58.89 s cadence. At these data collection cadences, the Solid State Recorder onboard the spacecraft can store only 5.4 million of the 95 million pixels available. The pixels collected are chosen strategically to provide postage stamp images centered on the positions of Kepler targets. The size of a postage stamp increases with target brightness and the average yield is 166,000 targets per month.

A critical concept for understanding artifact issues in Kepler light curves is that in order to maximize the target yield, postage stamp sizes and shapes are chosen to maximize the signal-to-noise on the 3-12 hour timescales of exoplanet transits. Postage stamp pixels are chosen by a calculation that combines the photometry and astrometry within the Kepler Input Catalog and an analytical model for the detector and optics. Any variation in the position of the target within the postage stamp or the focus of the telescope will result in a redistribution of flux within the postage stamp pixels.

The target pixel files are the rawest form of target-specific data
available from the Kepler archive. Each row in the TPF table contains
timestamps, photometric measurements, astrometric measurements and
data quality flags.

The TPF data format is defined in section 2.3.2 of the Kepler Archive Manual. Resources for inspecting and analyzing the TPFs are provided here. TPFs are delivered to the public on a 3 month schedule. Long cadence TPFs contain 3-month baseline time series. Short cadence data contain 1-month baseline time series. TPFs can be downloaded from a dedicated data retrieval page at MAST. A cursory tour of an TPF file is here. 

## Light curve files

The light curves are derived from the TPFs. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the files and time timestamps and quality flags within the two products are identical. The primary data within the light curve file is Simple Aperture Photometry - a summation of the calibrated pixels in the TPF. The nominal spacecraft pointing is good to typically 20 milli-arcsec over 6.5 hours but the high precision light curves still contain systematic noise. Noise (artifacts) manifest from thermally-driven focus changes, pointing derivatives and differential velocity aberration. Systematic artifacts within the light curves associated with these events and are the result of both time-dependent light losses falling out of the pixel apertures and time-dependent contamination of neighboring sources moving around within the pixel apertures.

Within the pipeline, artifacts are mitigated for using a derivative of principle component analysis. The product of this analysis is provided within the light curve. It is the prerogative of archive users to determine whether the pipeline mitigation is suitable for their scientific goals or whether manual mitigation will be required.

Light curve files also contain centroid measurements derived from the
TPFs. Since many artifacts are the result of target motion within its
pixel aperture, time-resolved correlations between target flux and
motion provide useful diagnostics of systematic artifacts within the
time series.

The light curve file format is defined in section 2.3.1 of the Kepler Archive Manual. Resources for inspecting and analyzing the light curves are provided here. Light curves are delivered to the public on a 3 month schedule. Light curves can be downloaded from a dedicated data retrieval page at MAST, the same location as the TPFs. A cursory tour of a light curve file is here.

## Auxiliary data

Auxiliary data is not collected directly by the spacecraft, but is derived from spacecraft data. The current auxiliary data comprises:

### Cotrending Basis Vectors (CBVs)

CBVs for each operational quarter of the mission. These are derived by
the Kepler pipeline from Principle Component Analysis and used to
mitigate for systematic artifacts within the the target light curves,
as in figure 3. If Kepler users see residual systematic problems
within their light curve data, the CBVs can be employed in performing
a manual photometric correction, more tailored towards the users
science. Format and content of the CBV files is provided in
section 2.3.4 of the Kepler Archive Manual. Documentation for CBV
construction and CBV downloads is here. Software for applying the CBVs
to data is here. The content of the CBV files can be inspected with FV
or TOPCAT.

### Pixel Response Functions (PRFs)

The PRFs model the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the telescope with the pointing stability of the spacecraft. The PSF varies across the detector plane. There are three primary uses of the PRFs that require fitting to either TPF or FFI data:

Model pixel values due to a star at a specified pixel location with a specified magnitude.
Estimate a stars location based on its pixel values.
PRF-fitting photometry.
Model light losses falling outside a pixel aperture.
Model contamination from nearby sources within a pixel aperture.
Format and content of the PRF files is provided in section 2.3.5 of
the Kepler Archive Manual. PRFs can be downloaded from here. The
content of the PRF files can be inspected with FV or DS9.

## Collateral data

Collateral data is collected onboard for the purpose of calibrating science data. Collateral pixels estimate the bias level, dark current and charge smear that results from shutter-less camera operation. Pixels are collected around sparse fields in order to provide background measures. Each CCD channel may have up to 4,500 background pixels.
