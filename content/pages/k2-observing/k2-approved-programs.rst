K2 approved targets & programs

This page details the targets and programs that have been executed by K2
as part of the `Guest Observer program <k2-proposing-targets.html>`_.

The target list and approved programs are posted on this page
as soon as the mission team has prepared the final target list
for upload to the spacecraft, which happens 1-2 months before the start
of a Campaign.

You can click on the title of each program to read a summary
of the research objectives and view a list of the associated targets.

After data has been released, the 
`data release notes <data-products.html#k2-data-release-notes>`_ 
should be consulted for more comprehensive notes for each Campaign.

Campaign 6
---------------------
.. raw:: html
  
  <p>
  The Campaign 6 target list consists of 28,289 standard long cadence
  and 84 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included
  large pixel masks over 65 Trojan asteroids. Bodies within our own
  Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered
  by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that
  make up the path the Trojans move along. The Trojans were observed in long cadence.

Campaign 5
---------------------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
    The Campaign 5 target list consists of 25,850 standard long cadence and 204 standard short cadence targets. 
    We also observed Trans-Neptunian Object 2001 YH40 and the open cluster M67.
    The cluster was tiled with 72 individual apertures to create a contiguous 400x400 pixel region over two channels.

Campaign 4
---------------------
.. raw:: html
  
  <p>
    The Campaign 4 target list consists of 15,847 standard long cadence and 122 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over dwarf planet (250112) 2002 KY14. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled the entire extent of (250112) 2002 KY14 in long cadence.
  </p>
  <p>
    We approved one Director's Discretionary Target program in
    Campaign 4 which was to observe 9 very bright stars in the
    Pleiades and Hyades open clusters using circular pixel masks covering the wings of the PSF but not the saturation bleed.
