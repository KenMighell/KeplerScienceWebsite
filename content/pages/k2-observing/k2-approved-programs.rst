This page details the targets and programs that have been selected
as part of the `Guest Observer program <k2-proposing-targets.html>`_.

The target list and approved programs are posted on this page
as soon as the mission team has prepared the final target list
for upload to the spacecraft, which happens 1-2 months before the start
of a Campaign.  Some details of the approved programs are provided
here, but the `data release notes <data-products.html#k2-data-release-notes>`_ should be consulted for more
comprehensive notes for each Campaign.
