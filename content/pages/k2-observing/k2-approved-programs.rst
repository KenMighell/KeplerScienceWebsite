This page details the targets and programs that have been executed by K2
as part of the `Guest Observer program <k2-proposing-targets.html>`_.

The target list and approved programs are posted on this page
as soon as the mission team has prepared the final target list
for upload to the spacecraft, which happens 1-2 months before the start
of a Campaign.

You can click on the title of each program to read a summary
of the research objectives and view a list of the associated targets.

After data has been released, the 
`data release notes <data-products.html#k2-data-release-notes>`_ 
should be consulted for more comprehensive notes for each Campaign.
