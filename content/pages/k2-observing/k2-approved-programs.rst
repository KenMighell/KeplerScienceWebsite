This page details the targets and programs that have been executed by K2
as part of the `Guest Observer program <k2-proposing-targets.html>`_.

The target list and approved programs are posted on this page
as soon as the mission team has prepared the final target list
for upload to the spacecraft, which happens 1-2 months before the start
of a Campaign.

You can click on the title of each program to read a summary
of the research objectives and view a list of the observed targets.

After data has been released, the 
`data release notes <data-products.html#k2-data-release-notes>`_ 
should be consulted for more comprehensive notes for each Campaign.

Campaign 8
---------------------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
  The Campaign 8 target list includes 24187 standard long cadence and 54 short cadence targets. The planet Uranus will be observed for roughly a month in short cadence and the remaining time in long cadence, in addition four of its moons make the long cadence target list. Six Trojan asteroids and four TNOs round out the solar system targets. The irregular dwarf galaxy IC 1613 will be observed with a large pixel mask and several very bright stars will be targeted using custom pixel masks that only collect the wings of the PSF.

Campaign 7
---------------------
.. raw:: html
  
  <p>
  Campaign 7 there was a significant drop in the number of targets observed relative to previous campaigns. This drop was because the number of targets we can observe is a function of our on-board compression efficiency. The extremely dense nature of the Campaign 7 field forced us to assume a poorer compression estimate than we used for earlier campaigns. This target list consists of 13,469 standard long cadence and 72 standard short cadence targets. We tiled a region around the open cluster Ruprecht 147 using 60 individual pixel masks. In addition, we included large pixel masks over 3 Trojan/Hilda Asteroids and the (dwarf) planet Pluto. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that make up the path the Trojans/Hildas move along. These observations are in long cadence. Finally, we also observed 10 very bright stars by targeting just the central region of pixels around these targets but excluding the bleed columns.

Campaign 6

  <p>
  The Campaign 6 target list consists of 28,289 standard long cadence
  and 84 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included
  large pixel masks over 65 Trojan asteroids. Bodies within our own
  Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered
  by long streaks of pixels. We tiled just a subset of the pixels that
  make up the path the Trojans move along. The Trojans were observed in long cadence.

Campaign 5
---------------------
.. raw:: html
 
  <p>
    The Campaign 5 target list consists of 25,850 standard long cadence and 204 standard short cadence targets. 
    We also observed Trans-Neptunian Object 2001 YH40 and the open cluster M67.
    The cluster was tiled with 72 individual apertures to create a contiguous 400x400 pixel region over two channels.

Campaign 4

  <p>
    The Campaign 4 target list consists of 15,847 standard long cadence and 122 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over dwarf planet (250112) 2002 KY14. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled the entire extent of (250112) 2002 KY14 in long cadence.
  </p>
  <p>
    We approved one Director's Discretionary Target program in
    Campaign 4 which was to observe 9 very bright stars in the
    Pleiades and Hyades open clusters using circular pixel masks covering the wings of the PSF but not the saturation bleed.

Campaign 3
---------------------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
    The Campaign 3 target list consists of 16,375 standard long cadence and 55 standard short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over dwarf planet (225088) 2007 OR10, the planet Neptune and its moon Nereid. Bodies within our own Solar System move relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. We tiled the entire extent of (225088) 2007 OR10, Neptune and Nereid in long cadence, and we have tiled approximate 20 days either side of the stationary point of Neptune in short cadence.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was an error in the software we supplied to the community that reports whether potential targets fall on active silicon. The roll coordinate used in the software was 5 degrees off from the as-flown pointing. The result is that roughly 20% of proposed targets fell off active silicon and were not observable. We backfilled the target list with targets from lower ranked programs. The error was regrettable and we have put steps in place to prevent this happening again.

Campaign 2
---------------------
.. raw:: html

  <p>
    The Campaign 2 target list consists of 13,399 standard long cadence and 54 short cadence targets. In addition we have included large pixel masks over the clusters M4 and M80. If a target falls within either the M4 or M80 large mask it will not appear in the target list.
  </p>
  <p>
      Two Solar System bodies were selected - trans-Neptunian object (278361) 2007 JJ43 and Comet C/2013 A1 (Siding Spring). The Solar System bodies are moving relative to the celestial sphere and are covered by long streaks of pixels. The full cluster and Solar System pixel masks are made up of many smaller masks.

Campaign 0
---------------------

  <p>
    Campaign 0 was a full-length engineering test and is notably shorter in
    duration than later campaigns.  This in the only campaign where the target list was not selected
    by peer-review.  The Campaign 0 target list
    includes the open clusters M35 (NGC 2168) and NGC 2158.  These
    were observed using 154 separate 50x50 pixel masks.
