Title: K2 Campaign 9 microlensing experiment
Save_as: k2-c9.html

### Microlensing experiment

K2 Campaign 9 took place from 2016 April 22 to July 1 (with a
mid-campaign break from 2016 May 19-22) and was dedicated to
a study of gravitational microlensing events. The Campaign 9
microlensing experiment involved the Kepler spacecraft observing in
the +VV direction at fields toward the Galactic bulge. The aim of this
program was to simultaneously observe gravitational microlensing events
with K2 and from Earth in order to see a parallax effect in the shape
and time of the lensing event. Additional information on the
microlensing experiment can be found on the website for the
[K2 Microlensing Workshop](/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/),
which was held in May 2015.
[Slides from the workshop are available here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/by07zmun9e9m7l7/AABvWyEtYOpRbxLVDqvLsgKRa?dl=0).
The field of view for Campaign 9 is shown below.

The Microlensing Science Team (MST) was selected through a peer-review
process during K2 GO Cycle 3 by a panel of professional volunteers. In order to best maximize the scientific returns from the microlensing
data, Campaign 9 targets were selected by the MST in coordination
with the K2 GO and Project Offices. Campaign 9 therefore differs
from other K2 Campaigns, where targets are proposed by
the community at large. However, a small number of pixels were
used for approved Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) programs.  The
list of approved C9 microlensing targets and DDT programs can be found
[here for Campaign 9a](/k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-9a) and
[here for Campaign 9b](/k2-approved-programs.html#campaign-9b).

All data, products, analyses, and results obtained by MST members are
nonproprietary. Data are expected to be suitably reduced, analyzed,
and documented, and will be required to be delivered to a public
archive (reduced data and results) in a timely fashion on a schedule
proposed and coordinated with the MST and the K2 GO Office. In order
to aid the rapid identification and characterization of microlensing
events, raw data from Campaigns 9a and 9b were made available to the
community via the MAST archive. [Further information on the raw data can be found here.](/raw-data-for-k2-campaign-9a-now-available-at-mast.html)
All the processed data from Campaigns 9a and 9b are now available at
MAST as well. [Information pertaining to the release of the processed data can be found here.](k2-campaign-9-data-available.html)
