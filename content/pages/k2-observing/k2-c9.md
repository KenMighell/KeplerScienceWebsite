Title: K2 Campaign 9 microlensing experiment
Save_as: k2-c9.html

### Microlensing experiment

K2 Campaign 9 will be executed in April 2016 and will be dedicated to
a study of gravitational microlensing events. The Campaign 9
microlensing experiment involves the Kepler spacecraft observing in
the +VV direction at fields toward the Galactic bulge. The aim of this
program is to simultaneously observe gravitational microlensing events
with K2 and from Earth in order to see a parallax effect in the shape
and time of the lensing event. Additional information on the
microlensing experiment can be found on the website for the
[K2 Microlensing Workshop](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2MicrolensingWorkshop/),
which was held in May 2015.
[Slides from the workshop are available here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/by07zmun9e9m7l7/AABvWyEtYOpRbxLVDqvLsgKRa?dl=0).
The field of view for Campaign 9 is shown below.

The Microlensing Science Team (MST) was selected through a peer-review process during K2 GO Cycle 3 by a panel of professional volunteers.  The MST will coordinate with and make recommendations to the K2 Guest Observer (GO) and Project Offices regarding the observational planning of Campaign 9.

In order to best maximize the scientific returns from the microlensing data, Campaign 9 targets will be selected by the MST in coordination with the K2 GO and Project Offices. Campaign 9 will therefore differ from previous and future K2 Campaigns, where targets are proposed by the community at large. However, a small number of pixels will be available for approved Director's Discretionary Target (DDT) programs.  [The call for DDT proposals can be found here](k2-ddt.html).   <font color=red>The deadline for DDT proposals for Campaign 9 was December 10, 2015.</font>

All data, products, analyses, and results obtained by MST members are nonproprietary. Data are expected to be suitably reduced, analyzed, and documented, and will be required to be delivered to a public archive (reduced data and results) in a timely fashion on a schedule proposed and coordinated with the MST and the K2 GO Office.
