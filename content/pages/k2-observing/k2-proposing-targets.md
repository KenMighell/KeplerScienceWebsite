## Campaigns 8-9-10 (Jan-Sep 2016)
      
Final pointings for <a href="fields.shtml#8">Campaign 8</a> (RA = 01:05:21.12, Dec = +05:15:44.45), <a href="fields.shtml#9">Campaign 9</a> (RA = 18:01:25.08, Dec = -21:46:47.32) and <a href="fields.shtml#10">Campaign 10</a> (RA = 12:27:07.07, Dec = -04:01:37.8) have been set. We are requesting the community propose the targets to observe during Campaigns 8 and 10, while they propose to join the a Microlensing Science Team for Campaign 9.

* **Proposal deadline**<br/>
  Step 1: 23:59 EST June 02, 2015<br/>
  Step 2: 23:59 EST July 01, 2015<br/>
  
* **Anticipated duration of campaigns**<br/>
  Campaign 8: Jan 3-Mar 26, 2016. Campaign 9: Apr 7-Jul 6, 2016. Campaign 10: Jul 6-Sep 21, 2016. Start and stop dates are approximate, flexible and could be overtaken by unanticipated operational events.<br/>
  
* **One proposal or two?**<br/>
  In the interest of efficiency, proposers are requested *NOT* to provide separate proposals with identical science cases for each of the campaigns. If the same science goals are spread across both campaigns, please provide one science justification and two target tables, one for each field.<br/>
  
* **Target Selection**<br/>
  In order to avoid inefficiency for Proposers, you are encouraged to use the online tool <a href="ToolsK2FOV.shtml">K2fov</a> to determine whether your targets fall upon silicon and propose only those that do. The precision of this tool is a few 4"x4" arcsec detector pixels. The tool has been updated for the boresight pointings of campaigns 8, 9 and 10.<br/>

* **Should you apply for targets that do not fall on Silicon?**<br/>
  Please, no. The boresight locations for Campaigns 8, 9 and 10 are set. Proposing off-silicon targets is a waste of energy for proposers, reviewers and Project staff. Use <a href="ToolsK2FOV.shtml">K2fov</a> and apply only for targets that fall upon silicon (output flag "2").<br/>

* **The K2 Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC)**<br/>
  Proposers are asked to submit targets that have been selected from the <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">EPIC</a>. The EPIC plays the same role for K2 that the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142..112B">Kepler Input Catalog (KIC)</a> played for Kepler target selection. The primary purpose of the catalog is to define photometric apertures for each potential target by providing celestial positions and Kepler bandpass magnitudes. EPIC parameters are produced by source matching existing multi-band catalogs and calculating color corrections for the Kepler bandpass. The EPIC has been updated with campaign 6 and 7 sources. Documentation describing the compilation of the EPIC is provided <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/documents.html">here</a>.<br/>

* **What type of science targets can be proposed?**<br/>
  There are no constraints on the type of science or science target that can be proposed.<br/>

* **How many targets can be proposed?**<br/>
  Both long cadence (30-min exposure) and short cadence (1-min exposure) targets will be observed during this campaign. There are no constraints whatsoever on the number of targets that can be proposed. The total long cadence target list is expected to be approximately 20,000 targets per campaign. Approximately 100 short cadence targets are anticipated per campaign.<br/>

* **How many pixels around each target will be collected?**<br/>
  This is currently unquantified, but K2 target pixel masks are anticipated to be significantly larger than Kepler pixel masks. Extra halos of pixels will be added to K2 masks in order to capture uncertainties in field acquisition (currently a pixel) and pointing drift over time (currently a pixel).<br/>

* **Are there bright or faint magnitude limits?**<br/>
  There are no faint limits upon the brightness of targets that can be proposed. Bright targets will be significantly more expensive in terms of pixel usage. Targets brighter than 3rd magnitude in the Kepler bandpass cannot be observed because charge bleeding along CCD pixel columns will fall into collateral pixels of the detector. Bright targets and short cadence targets will requires strong, compelling science cases.<br/>


* **How do I submit a proposal?**<br/>
    * <a href="ProposalPreparationSubmit.shtml">Submit</a> Step 1 of the proposal by <font color=red>23:59 EST on June 02, 2015.</font>:
    * Compile the material required for your proposal. The generic content of the proposal is described in Sec 2.3 of the
    <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/procurement/nraguidebook/">NRA Proposers Guide</a>. Page
    limits and proposal content within the NRA Guide are amended within Sec 3.4 of the
    <a href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId=%7B980F0800-B319-53B1-A46D-EBF2E0BBE599%7D&path=open"> Cycle 3 K2 NRA</a>. We describe the content of the proposal
    <a href="ProposalPreparationContent.shtml"> here</a>. Briefly, proposers will need to:</li>
    
        * Understand the <a href="Science.shtml">scope</a> of the
        Guest Observer Program. Science papers exploiting data from the Kepler and K2 mission can be found <a href="../PublicationsAstrophysics.shtml">here</a> and <a href="../PublicationsExoplanets.shtml">here</a>.
        * Familiarize yourself with the <a href="../Documentation.shtml">technical documentation</a> for the mission.
        * Develop and justify a science concept for observations within the new campaign <a href="fields.html">fields of view</a>.
        * Identify appropriate targets for the proposed observations using the
        <a href="http://archive.stsci.edu/k2/epic/search.php">K2 Target Search</a> page as the primary (but not exclusive) source list. This search page provides for the construction of short or long target lists based upon e.g. celestial cone searches, magnitude and color.
        * Complete the <a href="ProposalPreparationTargetTable.shtml"> Target Table</a>, as an integral component of the proposal and as a separate submission to the Guest Observer Office.
        * Provide the administrative elements of the proposal including a proposer biographical information, and a statement of current and pending financial support.

    * <a href="ProposalPreparationSubmit.shtml"> Submit</a> Step 2 of the proposal to NSPIRES before <font color=red> 23:59 EST on July 01, 2015.</font>


## Director's Discretionary Time

A small part of the pixel budget may be allocated by the project as Director's Discretionary Time (DDT),
which is intended to facilitate observations that address
scientific topics missed in the proposal review process.
Investigators wishing to request DDT can contact
