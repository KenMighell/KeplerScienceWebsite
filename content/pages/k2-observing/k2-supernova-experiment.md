## Background

Following a call for novel science experiments to be accomplished during K2's extended mission,
feedback was received to enable a supernova survey
in which simultaneous ground-based spectroscopic observations
could complement K2’s single-bandpass photometry.
A limitation that K2 supernova scientists have faced in previous Campaigns 
is that simultaneous observations from Earth required challenging observations during twilight.
This will change in Campaigns 16 and 17, when K2 will observe fields towards the 
forward direction of its velocity vector,
enabling galaxies to be monitored in a field
that can easily be accessed from the ground at the same time.

The large sample of supernova light curves expected from this experiment
will improve the calibration of Type Ia supernovae for cosmology 
by reducing uncertainties in distance measurements. 
By determining the key parameters needed for distance fitting 
(light-curve width and maximum luminosity), 
K2 observations will improve the precision of distances 
that are used for H<sub>0</sub> and constraints on dark energy.

Moreover, traditional ground-based supernova searches
tend to find most supernovae only at or past maximum light.
In contrast, K2's continuous high-cadence observations will capture the early phases of events.
There is clearly a tremendous amount of information about the explosion contained 
in the early rise of the light curve.
For example, for Type II supernovae these curves may reveal the shock breakout (see figure below).
For Type Ia supernovae, the data may help elucidate the unknown trigger mechanism.
For example, if a mass-losing companion star is present, then when the expanding material from the supernova hits it, 
extra shock emission will be evident (e.g. <a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0275'>Kasen 2010</a>).
That emission, occurring in the first several days and dependent on viewing angle, 
requires early and continual observing of many supernovae to clearly define the circumstances of the shock 
and discover the progenitors of the events.
The K2 Supernova Cosmology Experiment will deliver a statistical sample of such observations.

## K2 Supernova Workshop

The K2 mission will host a **Supernova Workshop on Feb 14-16, 2017**,
at NASA Ames in Mountain View, California.
The motivations for this workshop include:

* providing an opportunity to plan the K2 observations with Kepler/K2 team members;
* coordinating the simultaneous, ground-based follow-up observations and proposals;
* preparing the data analysis and interpretation efforts, e.g. informed by the previous supernovae observed by Kepler;
* exploring synergies with other space missions, wavelength regions, and  science areas.


### Schedule

This will be an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference'>unconference-style</a>
meeting with a limited number of
introductory talks and a strong focus on participant-led breakout sessions.
There will also be time for writing observing proposals,
drafting a white paper, and hands-on K2 data analysis.

<p><b class="text-danger">Note: this is a draft schedule. Contact keplergo@mail.arc.nasa.gov if you have any concerns.</b></p>

<h4>Tuesday, Feb 14th</h4>

The goal of the first day will be to review the science that can and should be done, and identify the resources available.
