### Extending Kepler's power to the ecliptic

Kepler's loss of a second spacecraft reaction wheel in May 2013 effectively ended data collection in the original Kepler field after 4 years of continuous monitoring. However, all other Kepler assets remain intact and can be used for the K2 mission. Both missions are founded on the proven value of long-baseline, high-cadence, high-precision photometry and exploit a large field of view to simultaneously monitor many targets. On two reaction wheels, K2 is limited to pointing near the ecliptic plane, sequentially observing fields as it orbits the sun. This observing strategy regularly brings new, well-characterized target fields into view, enabling observations of scientifically important objects across a wide range of galactic latitudes in both the northern and southern skies. K2 is performing a series of long, ecliptic-pointed campaigns to collect data for the astrophysical community that will inform their understanding of planet formation processes, young stars, stellar activity, stellar structure and evolution, and extragalactic science.

In Jun 2014, K2 became fully operational, obtaining a photometric precision approaching closely that of the Kepler hardware it inherited. With an estimated [photometric performance](k2-photometric-performance.html) of 50 ppm (6.5-hr S/N for a 12th mag G star), the K2 mission offers simultaneous observations of many objects at a precision an order of magnitude better than is achievable from the ground. The proposed approximately [80-day observing campaigns](k2-fields.html) enable a unique exoplanet survey which fills the gaps in duration and sensitivity between the Kepler and TESS missions, and offers pre-launch exoplanet target identification for JWST transmission spectroscopy.

### A community-driven mission

All K2 targets are proposed by the community through the [Guest Observer Program](k2-proposing-targets.html). The K2 mission welcomes all proposals including, but not exclusive to, exoplanet, stellar, extragalactic and solar system science.

### K2 science motivations and potential

Provide a yield of hot planets around bright stars for follow-up transit spectroscopy in order to facilitate rapid advances in exoplanet atmosphere chemistry and the search for water, clouds and greenhouse gases

Provide a yield of small planets around bright and small stars in order to facilitate the most precise follow-up measurements to date of masses, densities and compositions

Identify locations and characteristics of potentially-habitable planets around bright M-dwarfs in the solar neighborhood

Determine if hot gas giants exist around young stars, or whether they migrate to small orbits at a later epoch by tidal or other interactions

Determine the relationship between stellar structure, rotation and activity within stellar associations over a range of ages and metallicity

Identify the progenitors of Type Ia supernovae from photometric structure in the rise to outburst maximum

Discover and characterize binary stars within open clusters and stellar associations

Characterize internal stellar structure and fundamental properties of stars using the tools of asteroseismology

Provide a large, regular cadence survey of AGN activity in the optical bandpass

Conduct multi-mission, multi-band monitoring campaigns of ecliptic targets using K2 with additional space-based hardware or ground-based telescopes.
