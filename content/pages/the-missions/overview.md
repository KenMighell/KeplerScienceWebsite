### Kepler: searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars

The Kepler spacecraft launched in March 2009 and spent approximately
four years monitoring 150,000+ stars in the Cygnus-Lyra region with continuous, 30-min
or 1-min sampling.  The primary science objective of the Kepler
mission was transit-driven exoplanet detection with emphasis on terrestrial, R
< 2.5 R<sub>Earth</sub> planets located within the habitable zones of Sun-like
stars.  Kepler exceeded its nominal mission lifetime of three years
and continued operating for an additional year as an extended
mission. During this time Kepler discovered thousands of transiting
planets.  The ultimate goal of the Kepler mission
is to measure the fraction of stars with Earth-size
planets as well as the fraction of stars harboring Earth-size planets
in the Habitable Zone, work which is still in progress by the Science Office.

The Kepler Science Center is dedicated to the service of the
broad science community, with a charter to promote the continued exploitation of
Kepler data and broaden the scientific impact of this mission. Kepler
data provide a unique combination of photometric precision, duration,
contiguity and source volume. The scientific community have the 
opportunity to mine Kepler's
rich public data archive. The community are encouraged to participate
in Kepler's primary science as well as exploit the mission's unique archive
and observing resources to pursue unrelated stellar and extragalactic
astrophysics.

### K2: extending Kepler's power to the ecliptic

The loss of a second of the four reaction wheels on board the Kepler 
spacecraft in May 2013 brought an end to its four plus year primary science 
mission to continuously monitor more than 150,000 stars 
in the 116 square degree Kepler field for transiting exoplanet
candidates.  Developed over the months following this failure, 
the K2 mission represents a new concept for spacecraft operations 
that enables continued scientific observations 
with the Kepler space telescope. 

The K2 mission entails a series of sequential
<a href="k2-fields.html">observing "Campaigns"</a> 
of fields distributed around the ecliptic plane 
and offers a photometric precision approaching that 
of the original Kepler mission **<a
href="k2-photometric-performance.html">to within a factor of
approximately two</a>**. Operating in the ecliptic plane minimizes the torque exerted 
on the spacecraft by solar wind pressure, 
reducing pointing drift to the point where spacecraft attitude 
can effectively be controlled through a combination of thrusters 
and the two remaining reaction wheels. Each campaign is therefore limited by Sun angle constraints 
to a duration of approximately 80 days. 

K2 is an entirely **community-driven mission**.
All K2 targets are proposed by the community through the
[Guest Observer Program](k2-proposing-targets.html). The K2 mission
welcomes all proposals including, but not exclusive to, exoplanet,
stellar, extragalactic and solar system science.
