Welcome to the home page of the Kepler & K2 Science Conference IV! Over the past 8 years, high-precision photometry from the Kepler/K2 mission has enabled breakthrough discoveries in exoplanet science, asteroseismology, eclipsing binary stars, solar-system objects, and extragalactic science. To celebrate the legacy and latest science results of Kepler/K2 we invite the community to the 4th Kepler & K2 Science Conference, hosted at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, CA. We welcome contributions from any area of science related to the Kepler/K2 mission, as well as related future missions such as TESS. We are looking forward to celebrating the Kepler/K2 science and legacy with the community!

### Registration & Abstract Submission

**[Click here to register for the conference](http://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ksc2017/registration.php)**. There is no registration
fee. When registering, we ask that all participants read and agree
with the <a
href='../code.html'>code of conduct</a>. Upon registering,
participants can also volunteer to judge
a poster competition and/or give a public lecture
the week of the conference. Winners of the poster competition have the
opportunity to give short talks about their results in a dedicated
session in the second half of the conference. Poster judges will rank
posters of conference participants who agreed to enter the
competition. Additional details on the poster competition are
forthcoming. Also, the opportunity to give a public lecture
is open to people at all professional
levels (graduate students, postdocs, etc.).

**[Click here to submit an abstract for the conference](http://catcopy.ipac.caltech.edu/ksc2017/abstract.php)**. Multiple
  abstract submissions are allowed. Note that Wednesday afternoon (June 21) has been reserved for breakout sessions to enable the community to discuss and work on Kepler/K2 related projects. We envision that these sessions will be more hands-on ("unconference" sessions) compared to traditional talks, ideally with broad interest to the community. Examples for breakout sessions could include panel discussions, hack activities, work meetings of larger collaborations, or tutorials to use data/software products related to Kepler/K2. To submit a proposal for a breakout session please select the appropriate abstract preference during registration.
