### Summary

The K2 Mission and STSci/JHU will host a Supernova Hack Fest on July 16-18, 2018 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

The Kepler telescope continues to deliver extreme precision photometric time series, with over over 65,000 galaxies measured to date.  Dozens of candidate supernovae have already been identified, including [Type Ia supernovae possessing early rise times recorded with unprecedented precision](https://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/bright-supernova-discovered-in-k2s-ongoing-campaign-16.html).  The flux time series from pre-outburst to maximum light can identify shock breakout and distinguish among supernova triggering mechanisms.  Recent K2 campaigns 16 and 17 offered the unusual ability to acquire contemporaneous space- and ground- based monitoring, including multiband photometry and spectroscopic classification.  Many transients reside in the Kepler/K2 data, including [fast-evolving luminous transients](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018NatAs...2..307R).


Distinguishing correlated instrumental noise and astrophysical signals remains a challenge to the robust scientific interpretation of supernovae in K2.  **This workshop aims to promote collaboration, tool building, and tool reuse for overcoming shared data analysis challenges.**  Tools may include Kepler/K2 and ancillary data analysis, or application of supernova theory to lightcurves.  We also welcome looking forward to synergies with the NASA TESS mission, which will yield a wider albeit shallower survey of more-nearby galaxies.

### Agenda

The majority of days will remain unstructured so that participants may self assemble.  The first day will begin with a short welcome from K2 and STSci/JHU partners, followed by pitches for projects or offers for skill sharing from all participants.  Days 2 and 3 will begin with a short recap from each team describing the previous day's progress.  Demos of the projects will occur on the final hour on Wednesday.
