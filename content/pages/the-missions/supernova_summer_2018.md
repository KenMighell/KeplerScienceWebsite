### Summary

The K2 Mission and STSci/JHU will host a Supernova Hack Fest on July 16-18 at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.

Since its launch in 2009, the Kepler telescope has been providing high precision photometric time series on over 65,000 galaxies.  The most recent campaigns for which data are available, C16 and C17, monitored 23,000 galaxies with contemporaneous ground-based polychromatic monitoring and spectroscopic followup...

**Scientific motivation**  

- K2 has observed over 65,000 galaxies
- Chief aim rests in early rise time of observations
- Identify shock breakout, distinguish among formation mechanisms
- (Embed YouTube video of SN explosions from JPL)
- Short-lived events like KSN2015k would have evaded most conventional ground-based transient searches.
- Applying theory to interpret the early rise in K2 lightcurves
- Predictions and applications for the wider albeit shallower TESS


**Technical motivation**  

- Dinstinguishing and quantifying correlated instrumental noise and astrophysical signal remains a challenge for ronbust scientific interpretation.
- Tools for transients and extended objects may differ for those created for point sources and planet searches, adapting these tools may be fruitful.
- Aim to promote tool reuse
- As-yet-unidentified transient signals may remain in the lightcurves of campaigns for which contemporaneous ground-based observations were not possible.
- Assembling and making available complementary ground-based datasets



### Agenda

The majority of days will remain unstructured so that participants may self assemble.  The first day will begin with a short welcome from K2 and STSci/JHU partners, followed by pitches for projects or offers for skill sharing from all participants.  Days 2 and 3 will begin with a short recap from each team describing the previous day's progress.  Demos of the projects will occur on the final hour on Wednesday.
