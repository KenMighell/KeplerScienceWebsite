## Science from Kepler

With over four years of continuous monitoring of over 150,000 stars in
the Cygnus-Lyra region, Kepler has produced and still continues to produce myriad scientific results.  Publications using Kepler data can be found [here](kpub-kepler.html).

### Kepler field of view

The Kepler photometer consists of 21 CCD modules (each with two 2200x1024
pixel CCDs).  Each module covers 5 square degrees.  The full 116
square degree field of view on the sky is illustrated below.
